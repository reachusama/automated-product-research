St Chad's School | South Norwood | Ofsted Report ""You do not shy away from topical issues in your ‘pupil vote’ activities and show courage in enabling pupils to talk about challenging topics, such as acts of terrorism or the ethics of conflict."" The Ashwood Academy | Basingstoke | Ofsted Report ""Leaders ensure that pupils develop an understanding of democracy, respect and other modern British values. Pupils regularly vote on different themes to express an opinion....Such debate enables pupils to express their views respectfully and have their voices heard."" Packmoor School | Stoke-on-Trent | Ofsted Report ""Pupils have an age-appropriate understanding of democracy. This is achieved through elections for class council members but also through the ‘VotesforSchools’ programme.""

The resources support teachers both with workload and with a 'hook' in to some potentially challenging issues. We love it here!"" Headteacher Caldmore Primary Academy What do schools say? ""I haven't had the full Ofsted report shared with me yet which is a shame but PSHE, which a) I am in charge of and b) owes a lot of its content to VfS was rated excellent.... the VfS system is the ONLY weekly opportunity and vehicle by which PSHE is delivered in our school (the rest of PSHE comes down to our enrichment, Respect Day programmes, some aspects of our RE curriculum and assemblies all of which are ad hoc) so I can't really understate its importance: Thank you!"" Deputy Head Bebington High School What do schools say? ""I would like to take this moment to say what a fantastic resource VotesforSchools is - it's so invaluable for teaching and informing the children about current affairs.""

Deputy Head Parkgate Primary School What do schools say? ""As a result of following the topics, attendance at tutor periods has increased and the feedback from staff and students is positive; they are enjoying discussing topical issues with excellent up-to-date resources."" Assistant Principal Reigate College What do schools say? ""VotesforColleges is brilliant. It has enabled me to develop the tutorial provision across the College to promote SMSC issues through the use of the materials, to a group of personal tutors who wouldn’t necessarily have felt equipped to deal with the subject areas ... The use of the materials over this period have proved invaluable and the quality of the resources is excellent… In fact, we had some AOC training in preparation for OFSTED and they specifically fed back on the use of VfC as a big positive!"" Head of Learner Support Services Guernsey College of Further Education What do schools say? ""Children punch the air when they find out it's a VfS assembly."" Headteacher St Chad's Catholic Primary School What do schools say? ""We love VotesforSchools here, it's a great platform for discussion & debating.

Head of SMSC UTC Plymouth What do schools say? ""My pupils say: ""It's my favourite part of the week"" and ""I really enjoy thinking about the topics and then voting."" They are now much more confident discussing each topic."" Class Teacher Coton C of E Primary School What do schools say? ""VotesforSchools is such an important part of our week. We display the responses from classes on a board for all to see, and we display the question in the staffroom and encourage responses from the staff!"" ARP Phase Leader and Teacher of the Deaf Five Elms Primary School What do schools say?

A A full VotesforSchools school subscription includes: 39 new lessons & assemblies, every year, with 15-minute & 45-minute options Access to 50+ additional resources on a range of issues Evidence of how Personal Development (SMSC, British Values and Prevent) requirements are met each week Free staff training and ongoing customer support Access to our growing Hard-Hitting Content Packages, covering topics such as SRE & Radicalisation A voting platform for young people to make their voices heard National data reports with class, school, age, gender and regional breakdowns Weekly home information sheets for parents, carers or independent learning Feedback from Government, professional bodies & expert organisations Q How do you ensure full curriculum coverage? A As a team of mostly qualified teachers, we remember the Ofsted stress, and are committed to making your life as easy as possible. We map each of our lessons to a variety of curriculum areas, and every single lesson comes with its very own curriculum map, showing what objectives were met in each lesson. As well as that, we'll send you termly and annual curriculum overviews showing you exactly how you've met each curriculum area. Q Do I need to be ""techy""? A Not at all! We'll send the resources straight into your inbox every week, to make sure you have access. We create both PowerPoint Presentations & Google Slides Presentations, for use in every school. On top of that, from sign up through to lesson delivery, our fantastic team are on hand to answer every query you may have. Q How long will it take to get set up in my school? A Not long at all! Soon after you sign up, we'll send you a welcome email with your very own VotesforSchools log-in details so that you get started on the very same day. We'll also send you all of the information you may need to get your colleagues up & running with VotesforSchools, including an invitation to book a 30-minute training session, where we'll introduce the programme to all of your staff & show them how it works. Q What is the VotesforSchools ""National Vote""? A Every week, we ask young people around the UK to share their thoughts on a key issue based on the discussions they have had using our lessons. From climate change to the cost of living, AI to anti-racism, as many as 60,000 votes each week are submitted for 39 different VoteTopics across the year, along with a range of insightful comments that paint a clear picture of what the younger generation think and feel. We then take young people's voices a step further, sharing their views and votes with key stakeholders and changemakers. The results of our weekly VoteTopics have made their way into national press, key policies, and Parliament! The impact that each and every one of our national votes has had is fed back to young people through the resources, so they feel empowered to make their voices heard in future lessons and beyond the school gates. Q What other opportunities does VfS offer young people outside of lessons? A VotesforSchools strives to help educators to embed youth voice into any and all settings, which is why we offer a range of other opportunities for young people to make their voices heard in addition to their weekly lessons: 1️⃣ We have our very own Youth Ambassadors, who give us insights into the issues that they want to talk about and why these matter to them. They even help us choose our VoteTopic questions! This year, our focus is on Bullying & Intolerance, The Online World, and The Climate Crisis. To get involved, click here . 2️⃣ For the wordsmiths in your class who have something they want to be heard on, we also have a Young Writers section on our website. This gives voter responses to a wide range of topics a platform that we hope will influence their peers and changemakers alike. You can find some of their brilliant work here . 3️⃣ In previous years we hosted our National Student Voice Awards, which allow any young people or schools to submit applications that showcase the impact their work on youth voice has had. With the help of a panel of esteemed judges, we awarded Primary and Secondary students and schools prizes and celebrate their achievements on our website. Find out more here . Q Do you offer discounts? A We do! We offer a multi-year sign up discount, as well as discounts for smaller schools or schools with special circumstances. We'd recommend you book a quick chat with one of our team to chat about your individual school, where they'll be able to work out an option to suit your school's needs.

Don’t take my word for it, see what our School Leaders say… I COULD NOT RECOMMEND SLT AI HIGHLY ENOUGH SLT AI has honestly revolutionised my workload! The number of options available in the tools section is amazing, particularly the personnel section which saves me hours of time. I also love the ‘chat now’ function which refines and edits my communication but maintains my tone of voice- it’s amazing. I could not recommend the SLT AI highly enough. Thank you so much! Millie Brook Headteacher – Carlton Primary School OUTSTANDING TIME SAVER! An outstanding time saver and guide. James Houston Principal – Newton Group HONESTLY CHANGED MY LIFE I just wanted to say what a FANTASTIC tool your product is! As a busy headteacher, I sometimes feel ‘trapped’ in my office writing responses to emails, EHCP consultations, policies or plans and your product has saved me SO much time! This may sound overdramatic but it honestly has changed my life! Sarah Bond Headteacher – Eccleston Lane Ends Primary School GROUNDBREAKING SUPPORT FOR BUSY SCHOOL LEADERS SLT AI is artificial intelligence at its best, providing groundbreaking support for busy school leaders, saving them time and producing draft documents with comprehensive, useful and highly focused content. SLT AI is a gamechanger and should be available to all education leaders. The Ofsted deep dives, policy helper and interview questions have been so useful, and the general chat function produces letters and documents from a few words. The cost of SLT AI is very reasonable and will be saved within the first couple of weeks of use. Andrew Berry CEO – Tilian Partnership MASSIVE TIME SAVER! It is early days for us in using SLT AI, however so far it has proven to be a massive time saver, and really appropriate for our needs. What has been most impressive is the customer care and how responsive the team is when you have a question or request. There is much more for us to discover, but I would definitely recommend! Tanya Moran Executive Headteacher – Abingdon House School SAVES TIME AND IS PROFESSIONAL SLT AI is an excellent resource which responds well to the many faceted role of leaders. It is very easy to use, with a range of resources and if something isn’t there then you can ask and something will be designed to suit you. Absolutely love this tool – saves time and is professional. Gill Humphriss Headteacher – Stratford Upon Avon Primary School NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING! The Senior Leaders AI software is an exceptional tool that has the potential to transform the amount of time senior leaders spend on paper based activities. The Senior Leaders AI software is nothing short of amazing. It’s intuitive interface and user-friendly design make it an ease to use. With just a few clicks, leaders can effortlessly create the reports and information they need, allowing them to focus their time and energy on what truly matters. One of the most impressive aspects of the Senior Leaders AI software is that it is ever-evolving. It adapts to the changing needs and requirements of schools, ensuring that leaders have access to the latest features and capabilities. This commitment to continuous improvement ensures that the software is a must-have for senior leaders. Phil Kyriacou Head Teacher – Tudor Court Primary School AMAZING TOOL FOR PRIORITIES! SLT AI is an amazing tool. I use it to give me a starting platform for jobs I have been avoiding. As a result I am ticking things off my to do list in less time, allowing me to focus on other priorities. As a trust we have requested additional tools which have undoubtedly helped our ten headteachers in getting their ideas onto paper. I thoroughly recommend, my only hesitation for those who think it will be a miracle worker is… it is only as good as the information you put in, however spending time on adding detail in the school information section is well worth it. Louise Clark Chief Improvement Officer – The Tilian Partnership YOU NEED THIS TOOL! Oh my gosh! You need this tool in your life. As a headteacher, I no longer have to face the stress and pain of a blank page or the confusion and stress of staring blankly while I think of what to do next or how to start. SLT AI does not do the work for you, but it does help you start the work. Anthony Evans Headteacher – St Michael’s Primary Bournemouth CAN’T THANK YOU ENOUGH I had a full days work to do today on Deep Dives …. this tool literally cut my workload down to 1 hour – can’t thank you enough! Chris Dyson Deputy CEO – Create Partnership Trust ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! This is absolutely amazing! I cannot believe how quickly I can get answers for questions! What a brilliant, well thought out tool! Laura Snowdon Head of School – Red Hall Primary School 100% EASIER AND QUICKER! It has been a game changer – in terms of saving time. Sometimes finding the right words for an email, especially those difficult emails takes up so much brain space but since using SLT AI this admin task became 100% easier and quicker. Kerry O'Doherty Assistant Head Teacher – Hackbridge Primary School FINISHED IN MINUTES! SLT AI provided a well-structured letter in response to a parent concern. It was more objective and empathetic than I would have written myself, given the nature of the views expressed by the parent. It was very detailed and with a few editing tweaks, finished in minutes. Jo Badge Head Teacher – Catherine Junior School CANNOT RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH! Despite only using SLT AI for a matter of weeks, we are finding it very useful. In particular for looking at strengths and areas for improvement on data sets we are using for an upcoming international inspection. 

Craig who runs SLT AI has been amazingly helpful in trying to understand the needs of British International schools as well as UK schools and will respond to emails and feature requests often within a matter of hours rather than days. He is looking at the inspection framework from international inspectors and what we need to produce for them, rather like an Ofsted inspection in the UK. 
I cannot recommend it enough and think it will help save SLT time so they can focus on the more face to face aspects of your schools! Sarah Green Head Teacher – St. Christopher’s International School, Malaysia HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL SCHOOL LEADERS! We have been using SLT AI since September and it has been money well spent. It has been a game changer for us as a senior leadership team and is a really useful tool for us to have. There are so many tools to be used within SLT AI and has saved our team so much time. To be able to download into Word and then alter documents allows us to still have the flexibility of ensuring you can hear our voice in the written word! I would highly recommend SLT AI to all school leaders. Jen Taylor Deputy Head Teacher – Longshaw Junior School A QUANTUM SHIFT IN THE EDUCATION PARADIGM! SLT AI – a quantum shift in the education paradigm! Countless hours saved allowing for more time to think. Intuitive, informed and reliable, SLT AI has changed the landscape for school leadership and altered the lens by which we view school improvement activities. Luke McKinley Head Teacher – Preston Bridge School JUST WOW! Just wow! SLT AI is both amazing and scary. The resource without a shadow of a doubt supports SLT in creating effective targets while also saving time, thank you! Sara Shepherd Head Teacher – St Margaret’s at Hansbury Primary School SLT AI IS A GAME CHANGER! SLT AI is a game changer… the tools within this website are fantastic and save me and my senior team SOOO much time. I would highly recommend this to any senior leaders. Even if you only used half the tools available, it is money well spent! Jamie Barry Head Teacher – Yew Tree Primary School CLARIFIES THINKING! SLT AI has been of great help to me in the way it clarifies my thinking on decisions using the chat tool. I also make a lot of use of the action planning features as a starting point to school development planning. The responsiveness of the designers is fantastic and they have added to the AI knowledge base following requests for support with Catholic Inspectorate documentation. Richard Sanderson Headteacher – St Osmund’s Catholic Primary School FIGHT BACK FOR SENIOR LEADERS! A fight back for senior leaders! Very helpful in shaping key school documents! Alex Kolb Headteacher – Coughton CofE Primary School REALLY BRING DOWN MY WORKLOAD I have found that with just a few dabbles SLT AI has already saved me time. Think of your school development plan and the annual headache that it presents. You have your priorities and objectives but the empty table needs filling with actions and these should be evidence based. This is where SLT AI has been so helpful! It gave me a collection of term by term evidence informed actions and outcomes that served as a first draft for my SDP. I could take this to leaders to further refine and debate as opposed to starting with a blank page. I am excited to see the tool grow as Craig responds to feedback and suggestions. This will really bring down my workload burden and allow space for time with people and creativity in the future. Anthony Evans Head Teacher – St Michael’s Primary I LOVE IT! I have found SLT AI very helpful in my role, it saves so much time and provides details it would take me ages to search for via the usual channels, I love it! Caroline Waters Executive Assistant, Clerk to the Governors CANNOT PRAISE SLT AI ENOUGH! I cannot praise SLT AI and Craig highly enough. 

Having a software device that not only saves time but also produces work that is articulate and relevant is much needed!

I would recommend anyone who is interested to contact Craig-he has been incredibly helpful and really knows what leaders need to make their jobs that little bit easier! Matt Harris Senior Vice Principal – Hugh Christie School SLT AI’S SPEED AND ACCURACY IS INCREDIBLE! SLT AI is a game changer! It has huge potential to give valuable time back to busy members of school leadership teams by rapidly producing draft reports that can be quickly adapted. SLT AI’s speed and accuracy is incredible, and it can answer almost any question/task you give it to do. Andy Calvery Assistant Head Teacher – Ilkley Grammar School SLT AI IS UNIQUE SLT AI is a really helpful tool which is continually improving as a way to support school leaders. Finding ways to give SLT time back is like an answer to all our prayers and helps us to focus on the things that make the biggest difference! Making the most of technology helps us all work smarter. SLT AI is unique because it focuses on the needs of school leaders and makes finding the right stating point that much easier. Claire Bills Head Teacher – Gunthorpe CofE Primary School ABSOLUTE LIFE SAVER As a new head, SLT AI has been an absolute life saver! It is easy to use and has saved me so much time already. Sally Gillam Head Teacher – Hackleton CEVA Primary School THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME BACK MY HOLIDAYS! The customer service for SLT AI is top class!

We believe motivation is the greatest determinant of success due to psychology research. Why can't I plan my studying? Why can't the AI There is value in planning and feel free to use your own planning apps. For flashcards, we've found Plans don't survive a punch in the face. Until you know what you need to learn next, you can't predict how long it will take. For example if you repeat most cards twice rather than thrice, that means in all future studying you'll probably need more time for those cards too. Our AI uses that prediction to optimise your studying. But to be accurate, it cannot see too far (a trade off). We won't promise you things we don't think work right now, and autoplanning up to your exam/essay due date is one of those. We are happy to be proven wrong. You can manually plan and use estimates.

Example If you answer several questions on Cars correctly, but are bad at questions on Motorbikes, Revision.ai will reflect and choose questions to identify your misconceptions, like focusing a question on Wheels. Once it identifies a possible misconception, it will create questions to overcome the mistake and represent this in the percentage completeness of your lecture! You can see the systems ""Third Brain"" score-card and list of your strengths, mistakes and misconceptions in addition to normal progress. This way, you can jump right into quizzes on your mistake topics, show them or discuss them with others, and reflect yourself on your learning. You can also add manual text input on your own thoughts on your areas of mistakes/reflections, to direct the AI your way too. One of the brilliant ways Revision.ai helps you be a better student than otherwise is that it can see patterns in things you might not understand. For example, imagine during a long lecture the following pictures are present, as in Open Stax Biology lectures: These are regions of the brain, and the region at the back of the brain is important for vision. If you struggle with answering questions about regions of the brain, but succeed at labeling the visual system, the ""Third Brain"" will create new text questions asking you to choose the right description for regions in the brain and it will provide you a short synopsis of the regions first to recap them. So this way, even though the original lecture assumed you knew about Brain Regions - in your case an untrue assumption which held back deeper learning - now, with Revision.ai, you can accomplish that foundational step to build the groundwork for learning about specific regions, or reasoning about how regions interact! This is the power of the both reflective, learning record and text based analysis that the Third Brain does, when constantly providing a fresh supply of New, Relevant, Answerable questions as you study. Can the Third Brain system build me up to getting great grades on my exam? According to our 50,000+ users, the system is ideal for Biology, Business, Neuroscience and Psychology students and helping with passing exams. By generating a comprehensive set of questions that cover each part of your slides and keeping a record of your knowledge, the system can constantly provide you fresh, relevant, exam-conditions-like questions as you go up into completing the whole lecture and completing it increasingly accurately as you study. Until you have consistently covered 80% of the lecture with 80% accuracy, the system always adapts and highlights to show you the next exercise you should study - by doing this, you do not have to think about it or struggle with analysis paralysis - you can just jump into conquering a small part of your lecture one after another to succeed! The Trophy system (provided only to skilled successful recalls of information from your slides) provides an accurate judgement of passing exams at US college level in our experience. Remember, the contributors to Revision.ai include 6 college graduates, with above average grades, so we know what you need to do to score well on exams! It is our belief that if you have recently achieved trophies on each exercise in your lecture, within the last 2 weeks before the exam, you will go in as one of the strongest students and get the grade you need. What you need is the discipline and hard work on studying on the run up to that, in the regular months before hand - and we help take a big part of the early and intimidating work by generating all your flashcards/practise questions for you. It feels lighter, and more calm, to study with Revision.ai this way. What Psychology research informed your approach? Our founder has a MSc Psychology degree with a focus on learning, as do two of our current/former interns. We use our knowledge of the subject area to apply several research findings, as detailed in our articles and technically in terms of their implementation here. Highlights of the research we have applied includes: The Testing Effect Spaced Repetition Summative Feedback research Misconception Refutation - Progress Gamification Mastery and indvidiualised feedback/planning - Blooms research Chi & Posners Theories of error types and learning modes What are the stages of learning on Revision.ai Revision.ai starts you off with the flashcards it has made for you for a given lecture. From there, you study exercises, one by one, gaining progress. The separation into exercises splits your lecture into relevant slides for that topic, and gives you a surmountable amount of questions for each exercise that fits your attention span. By taking them in order, you can familiarize yourself with the lecture, no matter how confusing some parts might be. As you answer questions to make progress in each exercise, you can ask the AI to explain with context to your lecture: Each time you study, the AI adapts the cards based on spaced repetition, and other factors. Each time you complete a session, you can view your strengths/weaknesses that session with a knowledge gap report: Once you are confident, you can use the Mastery mode, where you view slides, and then need to write out what you remember for a blurt/free recall rating from the system. This ""Learning Loop"" takes you from a few slides, to a few questions, then to recalling what you know. It's purpose-built to optimize your memory with a mix of easy and hard cognitive work for your brain - and to deliberately connect back to your original lecture with the slides relevant for the topic , while also ensuring that you are recalling information in exam-like conditions , the combination of which ensures you learn the right content (the lecture) in a comprehensive way, in the most effective method/fashion for the exam you need to take. Just stop and think for a second. How good does it feel to know you just accurately recalled most of the content of a topic in your lecture, and correctly answered short questions on it? Wouldn't that give you massive confidence for the exam and put you in flow state? This is the exact reason, as well as difficulty learning diagrams, that we built Revision.ai for Biology! Then, you gather Trophies for each exercise by accurately free recalling what the lectures say and answering short questions, like in exams! As you go, the system builds up a teacher-like picture of you, understanding the misconceptions and mistakes you are making, and any patterns you show. By looking at these, you can take rectifying learning , which quickly provides information on the misconception/issue, and then tests you on it. Your progress is also represented for the whole lecture in the overview, so you can complete each lecture. What's the evidence that this approach is more effective or advanced than simple spaced repetition? Yes, you can try generating AI flashcards for free, and add manual flashcards to sets. How does keeping track of my misconceptions help me get better grades? It's what you don't know and what your marker can tell you don't actually know that hurts you during marking.
                  Read our post on getting into the mind of the marker. Misconceptions being resolved is arguably the most effective way to improve academics core in a subject according to Mueller (2008) and following studies. It requires you to really intrinsically change your thinking patterns, reflect and overcome a hurdle mentally. What is the purpose of Mastery mode showing my slides for different topics in the lecture? It's key to the learning loop to let you soak in the information in context.
                  It A) activates the contextual memory from when you first learned it, from what the lecture was saying and what you were thinking,
                  but also B) enables you to focus right before you go into questions and blurting the material. Our design around the Mastery mode learning loop going ""Slides"", ""Questions"", ""Blurt"" is purposeful.
                  It enables you to tackle a topic comprehensively not just in terms of looking at all the relevant content, but testing your knowledge at different levels of difficulty to establish what you know, and in doing so, improving your knowledge of the topic. See here is the thing. I actually quite like listening to lectures, especially the first time. They are interesting! The highlights are great, and memorable-by-default to me. But the bits inbetween. The foundations. The information on the methods used, related/foundational studies - or the diagrams - learning those parts helps your career, your future, your academic understanding and going on to do research. But it does not stick out, and will not stick in your brain, unless you study those parts purposefully. Now you can try the traditional approach to make flashcards covering all parts and that's fine, but it is nowhere near as sophtiscated or effective as using the right learning techniques. It's also harder to not feel a daunting sense of fear that way - you can see the number you have studied correctly sure, but it's hard to study 300 cards. Every wrong one feels a bit worrying. The difference with our seperation of the topics into exercises and then taking Mastery mode for each of them is that you can consolidate your motivation, focus your attention, and show yourself as you apply effecitve learning methods that you can learn this topic, and can succeed. That's the feeling we want you to have and the rationale behind why the learning loop - informed by research - is built how it is. How does the AI motivate me?

How we integrate Arrow Right Opening up the world of AI AI can sometimes be a confusing place when you arenât familiar with the jargon. At Graide we not only want our community to get the most out of AI, we want to break down all barriers surrounding the technology and make it as accessible as possible. So click below for a quick terminology breakdown and weâll help you on your way to becoming an AI expert. View our resources Arrow Right Explainable AI (XAI) Thatâs because Graide is an explainable AI model Refers to artificial intelligence systems that not only provide accurate predictions or decisions but also offer explanations for how and why they reached those conclusions in a human-like, understandable manner. XAI aims to increase transparency and trust in AI systems by enabling users to comprehend the reasoning behind AI-driven outcomes. Sounds familiar? Large Language Model (LLM) AI Graide does not use an LLM and is far more powerful AI models that are capable of understanding and generating human-like text. These models have been trained on vast amounts of previously inputted text data and can perform a variety of tasks such as answering questions and generating creative content (like ChatGPT). Howeverâ¦ LLMs can inadvertently learn and perpetuate biases present in the data they were trained on, leading to biased or unfair outputs, and often lack transparency and accountability. Evolutionary AI This is how Graide learns and evolves AI that evolves and learns with each input, rather than being a pre-trained language model. This type of AI typically employs principles inspired by biological evolution and human behaviour. Over time, as the AI gathers more data and refines its understanding of how the user speaks and behaves, it becomes increasingly accurate in its predictions and responses.

The expertise and approach of Aptem’s Implementation Consultants enabled us to build trust and confidence from the outset – and it helps that they are great people to work with. Vanessa Jones Operations Director The industry as a whole is constantly evolving, as evidenced by the significant changes to the funding rules in August 2022. Layer that with our curriculum demands, client requirements and growth ambitions. We needed a system that is agile and a team behind it that can react quickly. Richard Bridge Director of Learning Technology Aptem Enrol is user-friendly, flexible and allows for compliant remote-onboarding. We anticipate that it will save us administrative time and money and save on mileage and printing costs, meaning that all-important first meeting with the learner can be focused on teaching and learning. Daniel Dowson Director of Funding and MIS Aptem was several miles ahead of everybody else.  A good apprenticeships management system isn’t just about the administration. It’s about the user experience, both for the apprentice and for the employer. In Aptem, we found a tool that is truly adding value to the service that we’re delivering. Terry Hodgetts Director of Corporate Client Solutions Aptem allows us to onboard learners and complete compliance documents remotely and efficiently, which has been imperative in the current climate and reduced the time spent on admin. With Aptem’s distance learning functionality, we can continue to provide our clients with excellent training online.​ Paul Wileman CEO We are absolutely thrilled to be working with Aptem as our online ePortfolio provider. All aspects of the organisation will have a clear view of our apprentices' journey with an enhanced enrolment process and streamlined procedures that span the whole apprenticeship. Our ongoing ambitions to grow our apprenticeship provision will be supported by this fantastic investment. Lynsey Whitehead Director of Business Engagement, Partnerships & Apprenticeships Aptem has allowed us to merge our MIS and our learner portfolio systems into one place, so we can now truly go out and say we have an end-to-end system for our learners and employers. It has also given us our first foray into ePortfolios for our education learners, so that’s a huge step forward. We now have real-time reporting and real-time performance management of our staff. Ryan Palmer Director of Quality and Impact We were particularly impressed by the enrolment functionality within Aptem, with its ease of use for both apprentices and trainers. From an SLT perspective, we will now be able to report from one platform on all areas of the apprenticeship provision, which will have a huge impact on our ability to scale and make data-driven decisions.
