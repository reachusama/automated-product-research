If you have a question we haven’t included then please get in touch. FAQ What is a checkin? A checkin is an individual question you want to ask a group of people. Each checkin includes: – A question you want to ask – A defined list of people who are part of the checkin – A reminder schedule to remind people to complete their answer – A summary schedule to send you a summary of people’s answers Each checkin is a self contained area for a type of feedback. We suggest creating a checkin for each type of feedback you want to get from each group of people. Checkins can be serious and work related when you want to get work related feedback. Or, they can be fun and personal if you want to spark some team communication within a checkin. Examples of checkins you could create are: – What have you worked on today? – What are your sales figures? – What are your numbers for last month? – What is your workload this week? – How did today’s event go? – What did you learn today? – What projects did you complete today? – What did you deploy this week? – What do you plan to accomplish today? – What are your plans for the weekend? – What are you prioritizing today? – What are your goals for today? – and anything else you want to aaask! How many checkins can I create? You can create an unlimited number of checkins. Simple. What is a reminder? A reminder is a simple email that reminds people to answer the checkin question. It’s sent on a schedule and at a time defined by you. This makes sure that people are prompted to answer the question on a schedule and time that makes most sense. The email simply contains the question and a button so people can click to go directly to the checkin to answer the question. What is a summary? A summary is an email containing all answers to the checkin question from the last 24 hours. This is a really nice way to receive all answers that have been posted so you can quickly review. Then, if you want to reply or react to an answer you can click it to be taken directly to the checkin. In each checkin settings page you can set the schedule and time for the summary to be sent out. Can I select which people receive reminders and summaries? Yes. In each checkin settings you can specify which people you want to receive a reminder and which people you want to receive a summary. This can be a different list for reminders and summaries. So you could have the same or different people receiving alerts and summaries. The power is in your hands! How many people can I invite from my team? The number of people you can invite depends on which plan you have chosen. We have plans for teams up to 500 people. But if you have more than 500 people we can help with a custom plan. Please get in touch to discuss this with us. Start 30-Day Free Trial Is this the biggest button on the internet?

Curriculum & Teaching Support,AI-powered question generator,HEducationist – Martin Compton @ KCL on HE + education,https://mcompton.uk,uk,UK,1 or click the image below I just posted this on innovation and I thought the way I got to that from an idea that popped into my head while listening to a podcast when walking to the station might be interesting for a few reasons,,,"HEducationist – Martin Compton @ KCL on HE + education Skip to content Search Search for: Close This set of slides accompanied a presentation I just finished as part of the University of Kent Digitally Enhanced Education Webinar series hosted and organised by Dr Phil Anthony . Phil has grown a huge following and it gave me a heck of a buzz of nerves when I saw how many people were in attendance. My tuppence worth at the start was an exploration of the shifting dynamics of AI literacy efforts at King’s. Luckily I didn’t dwell on defining AI literacy (or other literacies) nor did I want to labour the actual interventions we have experimented with: colleagues from other institutions covered that ground better than I could have done. What I tried to do was to show one slice of the complexity in terms of staff attitudes and responses from enthusiasm to scepticism and to resistance and account a little for that. There are many key tensions, institutional dilemmas and the practical realities shaping engagement with generative AI. We’re still working on honing the approach at King’s College London, including support structures, faculty, department and programme level interventions and policy considerations and we definitely have yet to nail the way we resource the literacy work, programme and assessment modfication work and infrastructure work across the board. Talking about it though (and also this week compiling a report on AI related work) did make me realise how amazing so many folk are at work. The effort and willingness to share, debate, experiment, research, design etc etc from staff and students is remarkable. Watch recording: Not sure how useful the slides are without me wittering on but the links are there so Access the full slides here: tiny.cc/deew1 or click the image below I just posted this on innovation and I thought the way I got to that from an idea that popped into my head while listening to a podcast when walking to the station might be interesting for a few reasons. 1. Because we talk a lot about transparency in AI use…well the link below and then the final post reveals the stages I went through (other than the comprehensive final edit I did in MS Word). 2. I think it shows a lot about the increasing complexity in the nature of authorship. 3. It shows that where AI augments writing, how challenging it is to capture the nature of use and actually ‘be’ transparent because writing has suddenly become somehting I can do on the move and 4. will challenge many to consider the legitimacy and quality of writing when produced in this way. I should also note that this post, I did in the regular way of typing direxctly into the WordPress author window without (not sure why) built in spellechecker. Here is the full transcript of the audio conversation followed by (at the draft stage) additional text based prompts I did while strap hanging on the tube. The final edit I did this afternoon on my laptop. Image: https://www.pexels.com/@chris-f-38966/ Mark Twain almost certainly said: “substantially all ideas are second-hand, consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million outside sources, and daily used by the garnerer with a pride and satisfaction born of the superstition that he originated them” and he is also attributed with saying: “A person with a new idea is a crank until the idea succeeds” Both takes, perhaps even  while being a little contradictory, relate to the idea of innovation. In this post that I initially drafted in an interaction with GPT Pro Advance voice chat while walking to work , I have thrown down some things that have been bothering me a bit about this surprisingly controversial word. Firstly, what counts as innovation in education? You often hear folk argue that, for example, audio feedback is no innovation as teachers somewhere or other have been doing it for donkeys years. The more I think though, the more I’m certain actions/ interventions/ experiments/ adaptations are rarely innovative by themselves but what matters fundamentally is context. Something that’s been around for years in one field or department might be utterly new and transformative somewhere else. Objective Structured Clinical Examinations are something I have been thinking about a lot because I believe they may inspire others to adapt this assessment approach outside health professions. . In medical education, they’re routine. In business or political economy observable stations to assess performance or professional judgement would probably be deemed innovative. Chatting with colleagues, they could instantly see how something like that might work in their own context, but with different content, different criteria and perhaps a different ethos. In other words, in terms of the thing we might try to show we are doing to evidence the probably impossible to achieve ‘continuous improvement’ agenda, innovation isn’t about something being objectively new; it’s about it being new here. It’s about context, relevance and reapplication. Innovation isn’t (just) what’s shiny Ages ago I wrote about the danger and tendency for educators (and their leaders) to be dazzled by shiny things . But we need to move away from equating innovation with digital novelty. The current obsession is AI, unsurprisingly,  but it’s easy to get swept along in the sheen of it, especially if, like me, you are a vendor target. This, though reminds me that there’s a tendency to see innovation as synonymous with technological disruption. But I’d argue the more interesting innovations right now are not just about what AI can do, but how people are responding to it. Arguable I know, but I do believe AI offers clear affordances: supporting diverse staff and student bodies, support for feedback, marking assistance, rewriting for tone, generating examples or case studies. And there’s real experimentation happening, much of it promising, some of it quietly radical. At the same time I’m seeing teams innovate in the opposite, analogue direction. Not because they’re nostalgic, conservative or anti tech (though some may be!),  but because they’re worried about academic integrity or concerned about the over-automation of thinking. We’re seeing a return to in-person vivas, handwritten tasks, oral assessments. So these are not new but because they are being re-justified in light of present challenges. It could be seen as innovation via resistance. Collaboration as a key component of innovation In amongst the amazing work reflected on, I see a lot a claims for innovative practice in the many Advance HE fellowship submissions I read as internal and external reviewer.  In some ways, seemingly very similar activities could be seen as innovative in one place and not another. While not a mandatory criterion, innovation is: Encouraged through the emphasis on evidence-informed practice (V3) and responding to context (V4). Often part of enhancing practice (A5) via continuing professional development. Aligned with Core Knowledge K3, which stresses the importance of critical evaluation as a basis for effective practice—and this often involves improving or innovating methods.In the guidance for King’s applicants, innovation is positioned as a natural outcome of reflective practice So while the new  PSF (2023) doesn’t promote innovation explicitly, what it does do (and this is new) is promote collaboration. it explicitly recognises the importance of collaboration and working with others, across disciplines, roles and institutions as a vital part of educational practice. That’s important because whilst in the past perceptions of innovation have stretched the definition and celebrated individual excellence in this space many of the most meaningful innovations I’ve seen emerge from collaboration and conversation. This takes us back to Twain and  borrowing, adapting, questioning. We talk of interdisciplinarity ( often with considerable insight and expertise like my esteemed colleagues Dave Ashby and Emma Taylor ) and sometimes big but often small-scale, contextual innovation comes from these sideways encounters. But they require time, permission and a willingness to not always be the expert in the room. Something innovators with a lingering sense of the inspiring, individual creative may have trouble reconciling. Failure and innovation We have a problem with failure in HE. We prefer success stories and polished case studies. But real innovation involves risk: things not quite working, not going to plan. Even failed experiments are educative. But often we structure our institutions to minimise that kind of risk, to reward what’s provable, publishable, measurable, successful. I have argued that  we do something similar to students. We say we want creativity, risk-taking, deep engagement. But we assess for precision, accuracy, conformity to narrow criteria and expectations. We encourage resilience, then punish failure with our blunt, subjective grading systems. We ask for experimentation but then rank it. So it’s no surprise if staff, like students, when encouraged to be creative or experimental, can be reluctant to try new things. AI and innovation I think I am finally getting to my point. The innovation AI  catalyses goes far beyond AI use cases. It’s prompting people to re-examine their curricula, reassess assessment designs, rethink what we mean by original thinking or independent learning. It’s forcing conversations we’ve long avoided, about what we value, how we assess,  and how we support students in an age of automated possibility. Even WHETHER we should continue to grade. (Incidentally I heard, amongst many fine presentations yesterday at the King’s /Cadmus event on assessment an inspiring argument against grading by Professor Bugewa Apama from UEL). Despite my role (Ai and Innovation Lead) some of the best innovations I’ve seen aren’t about tech at all. They’re about human decisions in response to tech. They’re about asking, “What do we not want to automate?” or “How can we protect space for dialogue, for process or for pause?” If we only recognise innovation when it looks like disruption, we’ll miss a lot. Twain, Mark. Letter to: Helen Keller . 1903 Mar 17 [cited June, 19, 2025] Available from: https://www.afb.org/about-afb/history/helen-keller/letters/mark-twain-samuel-l-clemens/letter-miss-keller-mark-twain-st Whilst some (many) academic staff and students voice valid and expansive concerns about the use of or focus on Artificial intelligence in education I find myself (finally, perhaps, and later in life) much more pragmatic. We hear the loud voices and I applaud many acts of resistance but we cannot ignore the ‘explosive increase’ in AI use by students . It’s here and that is one driver. More positive drivers to change might be visible trends and future predictions in the global employment landscape and the affordances in terms of data analytics and medical diagnostics (for example) that more widely defined AI promises. As I keep saying this doesn’t mean we need to rush to embrace anything nor does it imply that educators must become computer scientists overnight. But it does mean something has to give and, rather than (something else I have been saying for a long time) knee-jerk ‘everyone back in the exam halls’ type responses, it’s clear we need to move a wee bit faster in the names of credibility (of the education and the bits of paper we dish out at the end of it) as well as the value to the students of what we are teaching and , perhaps more controversially I suppose, how we teach and assess them. Over the past months, I’ve been working with colleagues to think through what AI’s presence means for curriculum transformation. In discussions with colleagues at King’s most recently, three interconnected areas keep surfacing and this is my effort to set them out: Content and Disciplinary Shifts We need to reflect on not just what might we add , but what can we subtract or reweight . The core question becomes: How is AI reshaping knowledge and practice in this discipline , and how should our curricula respond? This isn’t about inserting generic “AI in Society” modules everywhere. It’s about recognising discipline-specific shifts and preparing students to work with, and critically appraise/ engage with new tech, approaches, systems and idea (and the impacts consequent of implementation). Update 11th June 2025: My colleague, Dr Charlotte Haberstroh, pointed out on reading this that there is an additional important dimension to this and I agree. She suggests we need to find a way to enable students to question and make connections explicitly: ‘how does my disciplinary knowledge help me (the student) make sense of what’s happening, how can it inform my analysis of causes/consequences of how AI is being embedded into our society (within the part that I aim to contribute to in the future / participate in as responsible citizen). Examples she suggested: In Law it could be around how it alters the meaning of intellectual property, in HR it’s going to be about AI replacing workers (or not) and/or the business model of the tech firms driving these changes.  In history it’s perhaps how have we adopted technologies in the past and how does that help us understand what we are doing now. Some additional examples of how AI as content crosses all disciplines: Law : AI-powered legal research and contract review tools ( e.g. Harvey ) are changing the role of administration in law firms and the roles of junior solicitors. Medicine : Diagnostic imaging is increasingly supported by machine learning, shifting the emphasis away from manual pattern recognition towards interpretation, communication, and ethical judgement. Geography : Environmental modelling uses real-time AI data analytics, reshaping how students understand climate systems. History and Linguistics : Machine learning is enabling large-scale text and language analysis , accelerating discovery while raising questions about authorship, interpretation, and cultural nuance. Assessment Integrity and Innovation Much of the current debate focuses on the security of assessment in the age of AI. That matters a lot of course but if it drives all our thinking and feel it is still the dominant narrative in HE spaces, we will double down on distrust, always default to suspicion and restriction rather than our starting point being designing for creativity, authenticity and inclusivity. First shift needs to be moving from ‘how do we catch cheating?”’to ‘Where and how can we ‘catch’ learning?’ as well as  ‘how do we design assessments that AI can’t meaningfully complete without student learning?’ Does this mean redefining ‘assessment’ beyond the narrow ‘evaluative ‘ definition we tend to elevate? Probably, yes. Risk is real, inappropriate/ foolish/ unacceptable …even malicious use of AI is a real thing too. So, robustness by design is important too: iterative, multi-stage tasks; oral components; personalised data sets; critical reflection. All are possible without reverting to closed-book exams. These have a place but are no panacea. Examples of AI-shaping assessment and design: Engineering : Generative design tools help students simulate multiple prototypes or to visualise diverse possibilities. Business and Accounting : AI now handles significant compliance and tax automation Computer Science / Coding : With tools like GitHub Copilot generating working code from natural language, assessment may need to focus more on code comprehension, debugging, testing, and ethical evaluation and/ or problem-based and collective (and interdisciplinary) tasks. AI Integration & Critical Literacies Students need access to AI tools; They need choice (this will be an increasingly big hurdle to navigate), they need structured opportunities to critique and reflect on their use. This means building critical AI literacy into our programmes or, minimally, the extra-curricular space, not as a bolt-on, but as an embedded activity. Given what I set out above, this will need nuancing to a disciplinary context. It’s happening in pockets but I would argue needs more investment and an upping of the pace- given the ongoing crises in UK HE (if not globally) it’s easy to see why this may not be seen as a priority. I think we need to do the following for all students. What do you think? Critical AI literacy (what it is, how it works (and where it doesn’t),  all the mess in connotes) Aligned with better Information/digital literacy (how to verify, attribute, trace and reflect on outputs- and triangulate) Assessment and feedback literacy (how to judge what’s been learned, and how it’s being measured) Some examples of where the discipline needs nuance and separate focus and why it is so complex: English Literature/ History/ Politics : Is the essay dead? Students can prompt ChatGPT to generate essays but how are they generating passable essays when so much of the critique is about the banality of homogenised outputs and lack of anything resembling critical depth? How can we (in a context were anonymous submission is the default) maintain value in something deemed so utterly central to humanities and social science study? Medical and Nursing education :I often feel observed clinical examinations hold a potential template for wider adoption in non medical disciplines. And AI simulation tools offer lifelike decision-making environments so we are seeing increasing exploration of the potentials here: the literacy lies in knowing what AI can support and what it cannot do, and how to bridge that gap.Who learns this? Where is the time to do it? How are decision made about which tools to trail or purchase? Where to Start: Prompting thoughtful change These three areas are best explored collectively, in programme teams, curriculum working groups or assessment review/ module review teams. I’d suggest to begin with these teams need to discuss and then move on from there. Where have you designed assessments that acknowledge AI in terms of the content taught? What might you need to modify looking ahead? (e.g. updated disciplinary knowledge, methodological changes, professional practice) Have you modified assessments where vulnerability is a concern? Have you drawn on positive reasons for change (eg scholarship in effective assessment design)? (e.g. risk of generative AI substitution, over-reliance on closed tasks, integrity challenges) Have you designed or planned assessments that incorporate, develop or even fully embed AI use? (e.g. requiring students to use, reflect on or critique AI outputs as part of their task) I do not think this is AI evangelism though I do accept that some will see it as such because I do believe that engagement is necessary and actually an ethical responsibility to our students. That’s a tough sell when some of those students are decrying anything with ‘AI’ in it as inherently and solely evil. I’m not trying  to win hearts and minds to embrace anything other than that these tech need much broader definition and understanding and from that we may critique and evolve. I wanted to drop these two reports in one place.  Neither of course are concerned with wider ethical issues of AI and I do not want to come over as tech bro evangelist  but I do think my pragmatism and the necessary ‘responsible engagement’ approach many institutions are now taking is buttressed by the (like or no) trends we are seeing which are profound.  Barriers (as seen through eyes of employers) to change struck me too as we can see the similar manifestations in educational spaces: skills gaps, cultural resistance and outdated regulation. The Future of Jobs Report 2025 explores how global labour markets will evolve by 2030 in response to intersecting drivers of change: technological advances (especially AI), economic volatility, demographic shifts, climate imperatives and geopolitical tensions. Based on responses from over 1,000 global employers covering more than 14 million workers, the report predicts large-scale job transformation. While 14% of current jobs (170 million) are expected to be created, 8% (92 million) will be displaced, resulting in a net 6% growth. The transition will be skills-intensive, with 59% of workers needing retraining. Those numbers are enogh to make you gasp and drop your coffee. PwC’s 2025 Global AI Jobs Barometer presents an incredibly optimistic analysis of how AI is reshaping the global workforce. From a billion job ads and thousands of company reports across the globe, the report suggests that AI is enhancing productivity, shifting skill demands and increasing the value of workers. Rather than displacing workers it argues that AI is acting as a multiplier, especially when deployed agentically. The findings provide a counter perspective to common (and I’d argue, perfectly reasonable and rational!) fears about AI-induced job losses. Whilst I am still wearing the biggest of my cynical hats, I concur that the need for urgent investment in skills (and critical engagement) is imperative and, lest we lose any residual handle on shaping the narratives in this space, we need to invest much more of our efforts into considering where we need to adapt what we research, the design and content of our currcula and the critical and practical skills we need to develop. Given the timeframes suggested in these reports, we’d better get on with it. Audio version of this post TL:DR? No, it is not, so why would you embrace it? I have mentioned this before but it keeps cropping up so I am going to labour the point again. The idea of ‘embracing’ AI in education (or anywhere) can be seen to grow as a narrative throughout 2023 and was already on a steep upward trajectory prior to that. Google Ngram viewer for ‘Embrace AI’ But a significant contribution to this notion came in this HEPI blog of 5 January 2024 . Professor Yike Guo urges UK universities to move beyond mere caution and become active adopters of artificial intelligence. Drawing on 34 years of AI, data-mining and machine-learning research at Imperial College London and his  role as Provost at HKUST, he warned that AI is not a peripheral tool but a fundamental shift in the educational paradigm. His focus on structural, systemic and pre-existing issues in how we construct education such as  the persistence of rote memorisation in curricula mirrors my own case for using AI as an opportunity to leverage research-informed changes long needed. Professor Guo advocates for compulsory AI literacy modules that teach students to interrogate and collaborate with digital co-pilots and insists that the true value of education will lie in cultivating ethical reasoning, emotional intelligence and creativity which, importantly, are qualities that machines cannot replicate. He says (and I quote this a lot): “…UK universities face a choice: either embrace AI as an integral component of academic pursuit or risk obsolescence in a world where digital co-pilots could become as ubiquitous as textbooks.” I tend to agree with much of Professor Guo’s stance: AI will reshape (and already is)  higher education pretty profoundly but I find his call to “embrace” AI really troubling. This phrase seems to be everywhere in relation to AI. I hear it every day and I don’t  think it is helpful at all.  I embrace my wife and daughter (and, somewhat awkwardly, my son and my mum: it’s a generational thing I think!), a kitten, and even my Spurs-supporting mates last week when we finally won a trophy after 17 years of pain (see picture below). Me being embraced by my Spurs buddy ‘JM’ (Photo: Tom Sweetland ) But I do not embrace people or things I neither know nor trust. I do not embrace strangers. Even when I employed someone to complete a loft conversion, and we came to know them well over the course of the (interminable) job, we still didn’t end up hugging each other. Some people love their phones too much and might kiss and hug them but I think they’re daft. These are tools, nothing more. ‘Embracing AI’ narratives only feed anthropomorphism.  It also feeds binary narratives: are you ‘fully embrace’ or ‘outright reject’? Actually, reality demands something far more nuanced. To these ends, I am constantly challenging the idea of embracing AI. So, instead, I argue for engagement . We can engage with affection, care, warmth and appreciation, but we can also engage with suspicion, trepidation, anxiety, distrust, even fear. Engagement accommodates critical scrutiny as readily as it does positive and productive collaboration.So, bottom line, let’s drop the idea of embracing AI but encourage critical engagement with AI (in all its diversity…what we conceptualise AI as is another thing that vexes me btw). Also: Come on you Spurs! Inspired by something I saw in a meeting yesterday morning, I returned today to Gemini Canvas and Claude equivalent (still not sure what it is called). Both these tools are designed to enable you to “ go from a blank slate to dynamic previews to share-worthy creations, in minutes .” The resource I used was The Renaissance of the Essay? (LSE Impact Blog ) and the accompanying Manifesto which Claire Gordon (LSE) and I led on with input from colleagues from LSE and here at King’s. I wondered how easily I could make the manifesto a little more dynamic and interactive. In the first instance I was thinking about activating engagement beyond the scroll and secondly thinking about text inputs and reflections. The basic version in Gemini was a 4th-iteration output where after initial very basic prompt: “turn this into an interactive web-based and shareable resource” …I tweaked (using natural language) the underpinning code so that the boxes were formatted better for readability and to minimise scrolling and the reflection component went from purely additional text to a clickable pop-up. I need to test with a screen reader to see how that works of course. I then experimented with adding reflection boxes and an export notes function. It took 3 or 4 tweaks (largely due to copy text function limits in browser) but this is the latest version . Obviously with work this could be made to look nicer but I’m impressed with initial output and ability to iterate and for functionality in very short time (about 15 mins total). For the Claude one I thought I’d try having all those features including in-text input interaction from the start. Perhaps that was a mistake, because although the intial output looked great, the text input was buggy. 13 iterations later and I got the input fix. However, then the export function that I’d added around version 3 had stopped working so I needed to do a lot more back and forth. In the end I ran out of time (about 40 mins in and at version 19) and settled on this version with the inadequate copy/ paste function. It’s all still relatively new and what’s weird about the whole thing is the continual release of beta tools, experiemtnal spaces and things that in any other context would not be released to the World. Nevertheless, there is already utility visible here and no doubt they will continue to improve. I sometimes think that my biggest barrier to finding utility is my own limited imagination. I defintiely vibe off seeing what others have done. This further underlines for me the difference and a significant problem we have going forward. ‘Here’s a thing.’ they say. “What’s it for?’ we ask. ‘I dunno,’ they shrug, ‘efficiency?’ My prompt for this was: ‘tech bros shrugging’ ‘Deploying AI agents’ sounds so hi tech and futuristic to (non Comp-Sci) me whilst weirdly also resonating of classic 60s and 70s TV shows I loved as a kid. I have been fiddling for a while on the blurred boundaries between LLMs and Agents, notably with Claude, but what appealed when I first saw Manus was the execution of outputs seemingly beyond what Claude can manage. Funnily enough it looks quite a bit like Claude but it seems it is actually a multi-tool agent. I pretty much concur with the conclusion from the MIT Tech review: While it occasionally lacks understanding of what it’s being asked to do, makes incorrect assumptions, or cuts corners to expedite tasks, it explains its reasoning clearly, is remarkably adaptable, and can improve substantially when provided with detailed instructions or feedback. Ultimately, it’s promising but not perfect. Caiwei Chen Anyway, I finally got in, having been on the Manus waitlist for a while. Developed by Chinese startup Monica, it is an autonomous AI agent capable of executing complex online tasks without ongoing human input and created something of a buzz. TL:DR: This is the initial output from first prompt to web-based execution. The selection and categorisation need honing but this in my view is an impressive output . The second version after addition of a follow up prompt. Longer version: I wanted to see what I could get from a single prompt so decided to see if it could build a shareable, searchable web page that curates short how-to videos (under five minutes) by higher education educators demonstrating uses of Generative AI. I began by requesting Manus to collect and cluster videos showing how AI is applied in teaching, assessment, feedback, and research (Natural Language Prompt). Manus responded immediately by creating a structured project directory and initiating web searches to identify relevant video content, starting with collections from institutions like Notre Dame and Harvard (which it didn’t get beyond in the first iteration). Once videos were sourced, Manus automatically filtered them to ensure they were under five minutes in length (but failed to note that one wasn’t a video and others linked to same page where they were already curated!) and produced by educators in the higher education sector (this it did get right). It then categorised them by thematic area (Teaching, Assessment & Feedback, AI Literacy, and Research but the categrosations were not always spot on) while also tagging institutional affiliations (mostly OK). The tagging and filtering work pretty well but the actual sourcing is very limited in that first iteration. A metadata database was created to support an interactive interface, allowing users to search videos by presenter, title, or description and filter by category or institution. Manus built this interface and deployed the collection to a live web page: https://cjubrvkx.manus.space . It took about 15 minutes. Iteration is by natural language prompting for fine tuning. The initial prompt from me and the start of the executaiton of the processes After launch, I expanded the scope by asking Manus to include contributions from additional individuals and institutions- I threw in my old buddy Dr. Gerhard Kristandl (Dr GeeKay) who I know has a YouTube channel, I added me- Martin Compton (without any additional info) and it found relevant content from each of us. The other three potential souces I threw in reaped no reward though. This is the reasoning: I searched for content from Tadhg Blommerde, University of Sydney, and Monash University as well, but most of their videos exceeded our 5-minute duration criteria. I’ve documented all findings in the data directory for reference . Manus resumed its asynchronous task execution, searching for and integrating further video content into the existing framework enabling me to publish a second version . So the output works, I would need much more thoughtful prompting to get it how I want it and, tbh, there are better ways of curating YouTube content but the principle is what interested me and the output is remarkable given the stages and processes it went through. You can watch a replay of the agent in action here . Not as much fun as watching Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin combat THRUSH (I know, I know). Connie Gillies and Martin Compton It was a privilege to offer reflections at Professor Cathy Elliott’s inaugural lecture, Rewilding the University recently. Her lecture was more than a celebration of an academic career: it was also a call to action. A provocation. A gentle but insistent reminder that education (and nature and the world!) does not need to look the way it does now. A packed lecture hall listened intently to Cathy’s arguments, ideas and jokes: it was a tough act to follow. Cathy said she hardly ever lectures but a skillful lecture is a thing of joy and is utterly compelling and we were lucky to witness one.  Here we share some reflections on Cathy’s ideas and how they have helped shape aspects of our own. Cathy made clear that rewilding is not a metaphor of neglect or abandonment, but of restoration, connection and flourishing. It recognises that overly managed systems, whether ecological or educational, can become depleted, homogenous and fragile. In both cases, monoculture and rigidity are warning signs: what Cathy referred to as ‘command and control’.  The invitation we heard was to value and support diversity, likewise in both nature  and education, to value what is often dismissed, and to allow for the possibility of unpredictable, unmeasurable growth. This vision has shaped how we think about education and how we’ve each worked together with Cathy. Our own relationships, as a fellow academic (with similarly unconventional paths to current roles) and as a student (who had been disillusioned by educational experiences to the point of encountering Cathy’s course), and now as authors, as collaborators, is a component of the network that Connie has described as mycelial: Like subterranean fungal connections but nourishing ideas, allowing knowledge to travel, and making future growth possible. Like mycelium in forest ecosystems, these relationships and ideas remain largely invisible to the untrained eye, but they are foundational. They remind us that learning does not happen in isolation, but in intricate, collaborative webs. When students sign up for Cathy’s Politics of Nature class, they often don’t fully grasp the lasting impact it will have on them. A friend once told Connie, “A Cathy Elliott module will change your life,” and while the statement may seem grand, it’s not far from the truth. For many, this course didn’t just teach content; it reshaped our approach to thinking, learning, and even our careers. Cathy’s teaching blends critical rigor with intellectual play, making the class a rare space where students can be both creatively curious and academically rigorous. Most importantly, she empowers students to discover their unique intellectual passions, encouraging them to contribute perspectives no one else could, simply because they aren’t anyone else. Education, when rewilded, becomes an ecosystem. A space where mutual dependence is generative. A space where difference is not simply tolerated but required. It is through this lens that we’ve come to understand projects like ungrading, student co-authorship, and the politics of belonging, not as reforms, but as regenerative acts. These are not surface-level interventions, but shifts in the soil. One of the most notable aspects of Cathy’s work is her broad intellectual curiosity. She’s not confined to any one field of study — from politics and nature to democracy, development, gender, race, disability and sexuality, Cathy’s academic interests are as diverse as they are profound. In an academic world that often pushes students toward ever-narrower specialization, Cathy’s approach encourages students to break free from this limitation. Cathy’s teaching has long enacted this ethos. She nurtures students not through control but through trust. Her pedagogy invites learners to bring their whole selves, to make connections across disciplinary and personal boundaries, and to treat knowledge as something to be inhabited, not merely acquired. She encourages risk, slowness, reflection, and relationality which are qualities too often sidelined in institutional discourses of impact, efficiency and performance. The dandelion is another metaphor Cathy draws on frequently and one we were also drawn to in our appreciation. Often dismissed as a weed, the dandelion (The French is ‘pissenlit’ which really does say everything about its reputation)  is in fact a profoundly restorative plant. It detoxifies soil, strengthens roots and nourishes ecosystems. It grows where it is not wanted and flourishes nonetheless. To children, it is a source of wonder, blown seeds, floating wishes,transformation, softness at one time, vibrant yellow before. But to adults, it is a nuisance to be removed. Cathy’s work, like the dandelion, asks us to reconsider who gets to decide what counts as valuable, as beautiful, as worthy. We need to ask ourselves to what extent have we constructed educational systems that we want to be like perfect lawns- predictable, clean, neat and each blade of grass much like the others. Cathy says: ‘don’t cut the grass and plant wildflowers instead!’ This is a literal and metaphorical phrase we can get behind! This ethos extends into her work on gender, race and sexuality, which consistently challenges the structures that exclude some or  may diminish the presence or experience of others. In classrooms, in curricula, in institutional policy, she reminds us in her work that exclusion is never accidental, it is designed. But that also gives us pause for positive reflection: this means they can be redesigned. What we’ve come to understand through Cathy’s influence, and through our ongoing partnership, is that rewilding higher education is not a metaphorical indulgence, it is a pedagogical imperative. It calls us to rethink the terms of participation, the assumptions of merit, the rituals of assessment, and the conditions under which learning takes place. It also calls for attention to scale: recognising that large transformations begin with small shifts, relationships and new practices. It felt fitting, then, that the very day after Cathy’s lecture, a special issue of the Journal of Learning Development in Higher Education was published. Co-edited by one of us and containing a piece co-authored by the other , the issue is seeded with many of these same ideas. It features students and a Vice Chancellor; early career ac academics and emeritus professors, reimaginings of assessment, and reflections on academic community that echo and extend Cathy’s provocations. The special issue is a timely continuation of many of the conversations we have had with Cathy, who, unsurprisingly, also has a paper in the special issue and was part of the King’s/ UCL editorial collective. We both have very different careers and are at very different ends of them! But we share the sense that the rigid, often foreboding and frequently distrustful academy could be rewilded. It doesn’t have to be this way; more importantly, it could be otherwise. I did a session earlier today for the RAISE special interest group on AI . I thought I’d have a bit of fun with it 1. because I was originally invited by Dr. Tadhg Blommerde (and Dr. Amarpreet Kaur) who likes a heterodox approach ( see his YouTube channel here ) and 2. Because I was preparing on Friday evening and my daughter was looking over my shoulder and suggesting more and more memes. Anyway, I was just reading the chat back and note my former colleague Steve asked: “Is the rest of the sector really short of memes these days now that Martin has them all?” I felt guilty so decided to share them back. My point: There’s a danger we assume students will invariably cheat if given the chance. This meme challenges educators to reconsider what they define as cheating and encourages transparent, explicit dialogue around academic integrity. What will we lose if we assume all students are all about pulling a fast one? My daughter (aged 13) suggested this one. How teachers view ChatGPT output: homogenised, overly polished essays lacking individuality. My daughter used the ‘who will be the next contestant on ‘The Bachelor’ (some reality show I am told) image to illustrate how teachers confidently claim they can spot AI-generated assignments because “they all look the same.” My point: I think this highlights early scepticism about AI-produced writing but that we should as educators consider the extent to which these tools have evolved beyond initial assumptions and remind our students (and ourselves) that imperfections and quirks can define a style. Just ask anyone reading one of my metaphor-stretched, overly complex sentences. Perhaps, for too long we have over-valued grammatical accuracy and formulaic writing? My point: It’s not just about AI detectors of course. It’s more that this is an arms race we can’t win. If we see big tech as our enemy then fighting back with more of their big tech makes no sense. If we see students as the enemy then we have a much bigger problem. Collective punishment and starting with an assumption of guilt are hugely problematic in schools/ unis much as they are in life and tyrannical societies in general. When it comes to revisiting academic integrity I am keen discuss what it is we are protecting. I am also very much drawn to Ellis and Murdoch’s ‘responsive regulation’ approach . I don’t think I’m quite on the same page regarding automated detection but I do agree regarding the application (and resourcing of) deserved sanction for the ‘criminal’ (willful cheats) along with efforts to widen self-regulation and move as many students as possible from carelessness (or chancer behaviours) to self-regulation is critical. Pretty obvious I guess but my point is this: We also need to resist assumptions that all students prioritise grades over genuine learning and creativity. Yes, there are those who are wilfully trying to find the easiest path to the piece of paper that confirms a grade or a degree or whatever. Yes, there are those whose heads may be turned by the promise of a corner-cutting opportunity. But there are SO many more who want to learn, who are anxious because they know others who are being accused of using these tech inappropriately (because, for example, they use ‘big’ words… really, this has happened). ALSO, we need to challenge the structural features that define education in terms of employability and value. I know how to use chatgpt but I am writing this. Why am I bothering writing? Because I like it. Because – I hope- my writing, even when convoluted (much like this sentence) is more compelling. Because it’s more gratifying than the thing I’m supposed to be doing. Above all, for me, it’s because it actually helps me articulate my thoughts better. We must continue valuing intrinsic motivation and the joy students derive from learning and creating independently. But more than that: we need to face up to the systemic issues that drive more students towards corner cutting or willful cheating. By the way, I often use generated text in things I write. All the alt text in these images is AI generated (then approved / edited by me) for example. This leads me to the next one. I mean I do use AI every day for translation, transcription, information management, easing access to information, reformatting, providing alternative media, writing alt text… Many don’t I know. Many refuse; I know this too. But we are way into majority territory here I think. Students are recognising this real (or imagined) hypocrisy. The only really valid response to this I have heard goes something like: ‘I can use it because I am educated to x level. first year undergrads do not have the critical awareness or developed voice to make an informed choice’. I mean, I think that may be the case to an extent or in some cases but it reminds me a bit of the ‘pen licences’ my daughter’s primary school issued: you get one when you prove you can use a pencil first (little Timmy, bless him, is still on crayons). Have you seen the data on student routine use of generative AI? It elevates the tool to some sort of next level implement but is it even? I think I could make a better case for normalisation and acceptance of a future where human / AI hybrid writing is just how it is done ( as per Dr Sarah Eaton’s work- note the  firve other elements in the tenets. ) My point: The narratives around essential chnages we need to implement ‘because of AI’ presents a  false dichotomy between reverting to traditional exam halls or relying solely on AI detection tools. Neither option adequately addresses modern academic integrity challenges. Exams can be as problematic and inequitable as AI detection. It is not a binary choice. There are other things that can be done. I’ll leave this one hanging a bit as it overlaps with the next one. My point: We need to critically re-evaluate how and why essays are used in assessment. We can maintain the essay but evolve its form to better reflect authentic, inclusive and meaningful assessments rather than relying on traditional, formulaic, high-stakes versions. Anyway I (with Dr Claire Gordon) have said it before , we already have a manifesto and Dr Alicia Syskja takes the argument to the next level here. Really, though, you should have been there; we had a great time. Back to top HEducationist Blog at WordPress.com.

We guarantee for all the brokers listed on our site. If you face any issues with one of them, we will act as a mediator to help resolve your problem. Below you can read more about the ranking factors behind our algorithm. Regulation and Licensing A valid license from an accredited financial authority is a key criterion when choosing a forex brokerage. Smart traders always favour authorized brokers - this inevitably ensures their best interests will be protected even if the trading company declares insolvency. Licenses show which regulator controls the activities and quality of the trading services provided by the brokers. We only list brokerages within the regulatory ambit of the most respected financial watchdogs in the world. Some of them include the FCA (the UK Financial Conduct Authority), ASIC (the Australian Securities and Investment Commission), NFA (the United States National Futures Association), FINMA (the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority), and CySEC (the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission). Trading Fees Some brokers charge commissions, while others build the associated trading costs straight into their spreads. A commission is similar to the spread in that the broker charges it on every open trading position. The trader must then close their position on profit to cover the commission. Comparing trading costs is of the utmost importance when selecting a broker. Costlier commissions and higher spreads will eventually eat up your trading profits. The same goes for any potential advisory fees and account-maintenance expenses. Trade Execution Speed Order execution can be of vital importance for your success as a trader. The term refers to the process of the broker accepting and filling traders’ buy/sell orders on their behalf. The speed at which this happens has a direct impact on traders’ bottom line. Slow order execution speed will ultimately cost you money and vice versa. The quality of order execution depends on the respective broker’s software and the number of liquidity providers. Good brokers execute orders within milliseconds. Lightning-fast order execution results in several advantages from traders’ perspective - less slippage, fewer rejected orders, and fewer requotes. Withdrawal Processing Times Withdrawals should not take more than 72 hours after the successful completion of your KYC verification. Trusted and regulated brokers never find excuses to delay or decline withdrawals. Good brokerages never intentionally make it difficult for customers to cash out their trading profits. The only reason they hold customers’ funds in the first place is to facilitate trading and make it easier. Trading Platforms We list brokers using MT4, MT5, and cTrader as well as proprietary platforms after additionally checking and verifying their software. We favour brokerages with user-friendly and robust platforms with many additional features like charting and technical analysis tools. The lack of intuitiveness and tools can lead to a lower ranking on our behalf. Customer Reviews We collect and analyse reviews written by traders about the brokers we list on our site. Nothing reflects the quality of a brokerage service more than the feedback of real traders. We sift the most reliable brokers that boast the best customer feedback with the help of our ranking algorithm.

You might be seeking a project management training course to enhance your CV, learn new skills or validate your professional experience. Whatever your goals, the Parallel team are here to help you reach them. Professionals across the globe have discovered that project management training can increase their success as professional project managers. Project managers are required to be effective at planning, executing and monitoring their projects. In order to decrease the risk of deadline failures and to make managing projects easier, individuals should contemplate undertaking professional training and qualifications to enable them to embed their skills and enhance overall project performance. Because companies invest immense resources into projects, project managers need the necessary skills to improve the success rate of all projects. Undertaking the right course of study will prepare you for various challenges that may arise and support you as a project manager in consistently delivering successful projects. Find the right course for you Benefits for organisations Our research on the benefits of project management training shows that almost 90% of project managers who attended our training believe their organisation has benefited from the new knowledge and skills they learned. The organisational benefits of undertaking project management training with Parallel are: 1. Consistent project delivery When project managers understand how to manage projects effectively, they can apply their learning to introduce a consistent approach to project management within their organisation. This ensures that projects are delivered in a structured way every time. 2. Increased efficiency A project management professional can better determine the requirements of a project and make best use of the available resources, limiting the waste of time, money and effort. This means that an organisation is able to take on a higher level of risk and reap a higher level of reward due to efficient project management processes. 3. Higher levels of customer satisfaction When projects are delivered consistently and reliably, customers receive what they expect, when they expect it, within budget, resulting in satisfied customers. This will improve your organisation’s reputation and demonstrate your improved project management capability. 4. Effective risk management The ability to identify potential risks and manage those risks in the most efficient way improves a project manager’s ability to lead projects to a successful outcome. At an organisational level, this means demonstrating knowledge of risks and capability for dealing with them. This will provide assurance to your clients that you know how to handle complex projects and complete them successfully, even if challenges arise. 5. Effective leadership Project management training will provide insight into different theoretical models and practical approaches to leadership, encouraging project managers to become more confident and independent leaders. Good leadership will improve project team cohesion, further enhancing your organisational capability to deliver projects effectively and efficiently. Benefits for individuals The Parallel project management training approach provides individuals with the confidence to take on project management roles and successfully carry out project processes. It also provides: 1. Skill augmentation The foremost benefit of an APM qualification is skill augmentation. It helps those managing projects learn how to effectively schedule projects, create budgets and hone communication skills. These skills have a direct impact on the project manager, their organisation and the relationship with clients and stakeholders. APM qualifications are also suitable for PRINCE2 certification holders who require knowledge of other project management tools and techniques to acquire a comprehensive project management skillset. Talented project managers will be able to sharpen existing skills and learn new ones. These will have a positive impact on their ability to motivate team members and communicate with all levels of the company. Individuals who gain project management qualifications will develop skills in: Active risk management Budgeting Project planning, implementation and monitoring Team leadership 2. Increased chances of career growth Relevant project management training will enhance a project manager’s CV and demonstrate an ongoing commitment to their career development. An APM qualification shows employers that you are a capable project manager with valuable knowledge of both theory and practice within the field. The ability to demonstrate this knowledge and commitment will stand you in good stead for growing your career within your organisation and within the field of project management as a whole. 3. Promoting a common language Professional APM training reinforces the project manager’s understanding and utilisation of a common project management language. It enables the project manager to better communicate with their project team and about the project in a clear and universally comprehensible way. Bringing a unified project management structure to an organisation provides consistency and reflects a good project management methodology. Developing a career in project management If you are interested in the project profession and keen to pursue a career in project management, almost anyone can become a project manager with the right training and experience. It is a very rewarding career that you can do in multiple industries within the UK or all around the world. You might choose to gain experience in a range of industries or specialise in a particular area. Your career could follow a path in a strategic and commercial environment in, for instance, energy, construction or infrastructure. Or you would work in the charity, heritage or culture sectors. Overview Qualifications and work experience are a great asset, but there is no basic knowledge or specific background requirement to becoming successful in project roles. Delivering projects successfully is a role accessible to anyone. However, it could be challenging to become a project manager with no experience, although it can happen if you are moved into the role within your current company. In that case you will likely have valuable business experience and have been involved in previous projects as a user or stakeholder. Either way, you might consider taking one of the APM project management training courses to build knowledge, or perhaps gain practical experience through volunteering. Online project manager training is available, with access to expert course advisors (all you need is an internet connection). This will enable you to study at a time that best suits you so you can learn new skills and gain a recognised qualification while working. A knowledge-based qualification ensures you develop the skills required to succeed in your personal goals now but also develop a habit of continuous learning. Remember, there is no defined way to becoming a PM in the UK. You might start out in a project role and then consider taking a qualification later. You might also want to start with APM project management qualifications to build knowledge and understanding. Starting with a qualification demonstrates commitment to the field and an interest in learning more about the best practices of the profession. Becoming a project manager without a degree You do not need a degree to become a PM in the UK, and there is no degree requirement to take an APM qualification or a PMI qualification. The UK-based APM Association for Project Management sets out guidelines for the expected experience you should have before taking a qualification. However, this does not mean that you couldn’t take a more advanced qualification if you feel ready. Note that the PMP qualification from the US-based PMI requires 5 years’ experience as a pre-requisite if you do not have a degree as opposed to 3 years’ experience with a degree. The best qualifications for beginners The best certification for beginners can depend on what experience and job role you have. If you have little or no experience working on projects, the APM Fundamentals Qualification APM PFQ can be a great place to start. Alternatively, you could consider a project management apprenticeship depending on your learning objectives. Online training courses are readily available from accredited project manager training providers such as Parallel Project Training. If you already have some experience working in the project profession and want to formalise this, then the APM Project Management Qualification PMQ can be the best place to start. The APM has a royal charter so is the only chartered body for the project profession. This requires some experience of terminology and best practice, but provides a strong grounding in the practical application of project, programme and portfolio management principles based on the APM Competence Framework and APM Body of Knowledge . Benefits management and corporate partnership programme with a PMQ exam and a business case means a project fits with an optional break and experiences referred to a start date. APM Body of Knowledge Find full details here: https://www.apm.org.uk/book-shop/apm-body-of-knowledge-7th-edition/ Studying for the APM Association for Project Management APM PMQ exam You will learn about areas such as: budgeting and cost control schedule management project lifecycle resource management benefits management managing deployment governance arrangements business case sustainability You might also consider expanding your knowledge in a particular methodology such as agile principles and other accredited training from the International Project Management Association (IPMA). Starting out as a project manager You could look for a job initially in project support and building experience that way. If you have valuable business experience such as solutions development or transition management then you could transfer within your current organisation to a more project-focused role. Or study for recognised qualifications to demonstrate your existing knowledge, such as integrated planning, issue management or stakeholder engagement. You may be able to do this with the support of the Learning & Development department at your organisation or study independently before looking for a new role in a different organisation. It’s clear that there are many routes to becoming a project manager in the UK. If you are a recent graduate, you might be able to enter a graduate scheme where you are supported through work experience and courses to gain a qualification. If you already have work experience in another industry sector, you can demonstrate the knowledge gained and the transferable skills that you have, such as team management or quality management. You can also take training courses to demonstrate your interest in the field and commitment to professional development. Like any job, being a project manager is not all plain sailing, but it can also be very rewarding. Overcoming challenges and delivering a project successfully is immensely satisfying. Kick-start your career as a project manager If you want to kick-start your career in the project management profession, a knowledge-based project management APM qualification via the APM Association for Project Management is a good place to start. This will provide a solid background in the APM competence framework and also practical skills to apply to major project work. There is no set timeline for how long it takes to become a project manager. A face-to-face or online course can run for various lengths, from 1-day courses to five 1-day sessions over a 5-week period. It is usually followed by an online exam with either multiple response, short response or long response answers expected depending on the exam type. You may also have to undertake individual assignments. There are guidelines which recommend the level of experience that you need before taking each of the qualifications. Full details can be found on the APM website along with information on the APM PMQ exam and accredited training providers – see https://www.apm.org.uk/qualifications-and-training Qualifications What is the highest level of project management certification? As a chartered body, the APM offers the highest level of qualification - the Chartered Project Professional (ChPP). This is awarded to those who can demonstrate a high level of experience and skill over many years of working on complex projects throughout the whole project life cycle. What is the minimum experience for a project manager? There is not strictly a minimum amount of experience as different companies will have different expectations. Training courses and qualifications can help you to stand out and demonstrate your expertise. What is the most recognised project management qualification? The qualifications from the APM are highly regarded in the UK. The APM is also the only chartered body in the UK, and earning an APM ChPP qualification demonstrates an exceptional level of attainment. PRINCE2 qualifications are also popular in the UK, with their own methodology and ways of practice. Is it hard to be a project manager? You will have to deal with stakeholders who may disagree with your project or be working to challenging deadlines. But a project-based job can also be very rewarding. Overcoming those challenges and delivering a successful project is immensely satisfying. Are project management courses worth it? Training courses are an extremely useful supplement to your real-world project experience. For project manager-level roles, a course leading to a qualification may be a requirement of your role. We believe that training provides additional tools and understanding that are directly applicable to a project role and are, therefore, very worthwhile. Even experienced people can gain new knowledge, such as agile principles, to support their development. Can an individual be trained to become a project manager? We train individual candidates as well as corporate groups on our courses. The training is applicable for both individuals and groups and will suit any candidate. All of our courses will help you train to become an effective project leader. If you enter a programme or apprenticeship, you might need to provide evidence of GCSEs, A Levels or a degree qualification. At the APM PFQ level, you don’t need to have any prior experience. As you progress through APM PMQ, there is a need for further experience and knowledge. At the APM PPQ and APM ChPP level you will need to have extensive experience of managing projects and previous professional qualifications. Can you be a self-taught project manager? Yes you can be a self-taught PM or learn purely through experience and your contribution to real-world projects. However, we believe that attending a training course and seeking a qualification will help to solidify your knowledge. Attending a training course also demonstrates a commitment to personal development and to best practice. Do you need a qualification to be a project manager? There is no qualification requirement to become a PM. However, if you are seeking to stand out and enhance your CV, a qualification is a great thing to have. It demonstrates that you have a professional level of knowledge and commitment. It is possible to self study via online courses. Plus, a qualification has been shown to boost average salary in the project profession. How do I train myself to be a project manager? You can train yourself to be a PM through building practical work experience or undertaking self study. Training courses can be a useful way to do this especially via an online course. You might then choose to go on and take a qualification from the APM or the PMI to demonstrate your knowledge and experience. What is the PRINCE2 qualification? The PRINCE2 qualification is an internationally recognised accreditation. There is a Foundation level and a more advanced Practitioner level but usually the Foundation and Practitioner exams can be taken as part of the same training course. PRINCE2 is one of the globally recognised methodologies which develops the necessary skills to deliver projects successfully across any industry. What training is required to be a project manager? There is no specific training requirement to be a PM. However, many employers now request a project management qualification, such as those from the APM or the PMI. Many employers will support you in gaining accreditation. Training is then done through the right training courses and qualifications alongside working on projects as part of your role within a project environment. Which certificate is best for a project manager? The best qualification is the one that is most recognised in your industry. The APM qualifications are suitable across many industries and include agile courses. They are highly regarded and offer certification such as the Project Management Qualification (PMQ) right through to the highly regarded Chartered Project Professional (ChPP) at the highest level of accreditation. Project management terminology As a project leader, you will come across many terms and phrases to describe critical aspects of project management and the process of managing small-to-large-scale projects. Some are industry-specific while others address issues and activities within the project management cycle. We take a look at some of the most commonly used project management terminology and, more importantly, what they mean. From a project management apprentice to an experienced chartered project professional , there are keywords and phrases that need to be in your vocabulary… Terminology Agile The agile family of methodologies is a developmental approach that aims to meet changing customer requirements. Its development as part of a project depends on what are known as sprints. In these sprints, the improvements are incremental, making it a responsive process for projects in which the approach needs to adapt and change. An agile project management approach focuses on teamwork, improved collaboration and stakeholder involvement by using what is known as iterative development methods. Agile software development is often used in conjunction with these working methods but agile projects are not only confined to the IT industry. This stresses the importance of being reactive in a changing project management environment. Analytical estimating This is a technique in which total project time and costs are estimated by examining each project activity and adding them together. It is considered the most accurate estimation technique within project management. BOSCARD This is an acronym that stands for background, objectives, scope, constraints, assumptions, risks and deliverables. It is a method that examines all of these components of a new project. Budget As you would expect, this refers to the total sum of money allocated to a project. Within this, there are two further phrases that you will come across: Budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP) – is the portion of the budget allocated to scheduled work in a period of time. You may also see this referred to as earned value. Budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS) – is the portion of the budget set aside to pay for upcoming works schedule as part of the project and also refers to a period of time. You may see this referred to as planned value . Capability Maturity Model (CMM) This is the model used to assess the maturity of a process within the overall project management process. It allows the assessment of an organisation or project management process against external benchmarks. Essentially, this is a process of improving delivery. CAPEX Referring to capital expenditure, this is the money that a company spends to acquire a fixed physical asset or to upgrade existing ones. Champion A project champion is an informal role but one that is increasingly used to drive a project team forward. This person cajoles, enthuses and pushes the project team to deliver on a project. They support the PM and will also liaise with the project stakeholders. Decision tree analysis A diagrammatic technique that shows the chain of decisions within a project. It examines the implications of multiple decision making, a technique used to improve both delivery and the process of project management. Do nothing option This is the element of a project that defines what would happen if the project was not undertaken. It may be that there are very few, if any, consequences of the project not happening. Fast-tracking As the name suggests, this is when a part of the project management process is compressed so that results are seen quickly. However, it is a planned process over a duration which means that the quality of delivery is still maintained. Fixed price contract Also known as FPC , this is when a fee is agreed upon that covers the entirety of the project and does not include variables such as time or costs. Hammock activity Seen in a schedule network diagram, a hammock activity is a type of summary process that represents a number of groups but often unrelated smaller activities that occur between two points in time. HERMES Created by the Swiss government, this is a project management method that is used by many IT and business organisations. It is a simplified project management tool that can be adapted as per the complexities within a given project. For it to be successful, a project leader needs to use the set templates within the system. Hypercritical activities This is when an activity is not given enough time to be completed, and yet when it cannot be finished in the time allocated, it collides with future activities considered essential for keeping the project on time. Negative slack time refers to when there is not enough time to complete a project. Initiation phase This is the official or formal start of a new project. This means that authorisation has been received as well as clear definition for the project. Integrated Master Plan (IMP) This is a project management tool that is used to break down a large, complex project into more manageable pieces or activities. It lists the tasks and events needed to happen for the project to be completed using a hierarchical structure and also shows the relationship between one activity and another. Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) Produced from the IMP, this is a list of all project tasks as well as a networked schedule. Notice how both definitions talk about the relationship between one task or activity and the others on the plan. Management process This is the act of planning and delivering a project or the process needed to meet the desired objectives and goals. There are multiple levels at which this is carried out, especially in larger projects. Management reserve This is the allocation of variables such as money and time (or both) that addresses unforeseen circumstances that can and do crop up during the life cycle of a project. A contingency reserve is when money or time is ‘kept back’ to serve known possibilities. This reserve is for things that are not foreseen. Any withdrawals from this reserve need to be agreed by all senior managers. Management science This is the study of how to improve organisational decision-making by using quantitative and scientific research methods. It looks at management decisions and outcomes, seeking to find optimal solutions to problems. Essentially, it is about studying how better decision making can happen. Merge point In any given project, there will be a point – the merge point – in which the train of smaller project tasks and activities will meet. The successor activity (the activity that continues when all these smaller tasks have merged) cannot happen until all the smaller tasks have been completed. Near critical activity This is an activity that has only a small amount of slack time. These activities have a high chance of becoming critical since they are up against a deadline, within which there is little time to be able to make changes. Near critical path This refers to a series of activities that has a small amount of slack time which means that again, the slack time could be easily and quickly exhausted, turning these sets of activities into the critical band. Operations management This is a duty of some or all PMs, depending on the project and position, that ensure the optimum operations function. In other words, it is managing the resources of the project, people included, to be continually working at the highest level of efficiency. By doing so, the project budget is optimised too. Order of magnitude estimate At the very early stages of a project, when an estimate of costs is given, it is known as an order of magnitude estimate. It is a cost estimate that has a range of between -25% to +75% of what the actual budget ends up being. Qualitative risk analysis This is a project management technique that is a subjective analysis of risk probability and impact. Quantitative risk analysis This is the mathematical or objective analysis related to risk probability and impact. It is conducted after a qualitative risk analysis as one informs the other, especially as during this earlier process, areas of significance are often defined. RAID log RAID is an acronym for risks, assumptions, issues and dependencies. It is a project management tool that records developments across these four areas as they relate to the project in hand. It is normally carried out for the stakeholder’s benefit and is often used at the end of project review. RASCI or RACI chart A RASCI chart is created at the start of the project and sets out who is responsible and accountable for ensuring that work is done and who signs off key parts of the project. A RACI chart is a simplified version of RASCI. Repeatable This is used to describe a sequence of activities that can be easily and efficiently repeated. Such processes are economical since they avoid negative impacts on a project and come from established processes that work. S-curve analysis S-curve analysis is used to compare the cumulative costs of a project at any one time. It allows an assessment of performance and progress at any time in the project. Schedule performance index (SPI) This is the ratio of earned value to the planned value at any given point in the project. It shows whether a project is running to schedule. An SPI rating of lower than one means the project is behind schedule, whereas a rating above one shows that a project is ahead of schedule. Scope A word that is used often, this refers to the entirety of the project and what it needs to accomplish in order to be successful. A scope baseline refers to expectations and requirements to deliver the project while scope creep is the changes that occur during the project life. This is considered negative, however, as it affects costs and schedule of a project. Scope change management This deals with any amendments in the baseline. Because changes in the initial scope will have time and cost implications, this process will mean revising estimates of both. Stakeholders will need this information and will underpin any new or different resources needed to complete the project. Six Sigma This is the approach to project management that focuses on the near-elimination of product or service defects. Using quality management methods, it seeks to improve and optimise processes in the product of a product or service so that 99.99966% of the process outcomes are defect free. Slack time This refers to the length of time between one activity and the next that can be delayed without affecting the duration of the project overall. Task In project management, a task is a unit of work that is time-bound and needs to be completed to meet project goals. A task can be broken down into assignments or sub-tasks. Task analysis This details the actions of resources needed to complete a task. Three-point estimating This is an estimating technique that uses averages of three types of cost – most likely, optimistic and pessimistic. It also refers to the duration of these costs. Time and material contract Unlike a fixed contract, this is a contract type that refers to payment per unit of time and also the costs of materials for the contracted work or project. Time chainage diagram This is a visual representation of the scheduled activities for a project. It is often used in projects, such as civil engineering projects from road laying to pipeline work. This is because the diagram is in sequence, providing a scheduled time of completion at each geographical location and the activity involved. In summary There are many more keywords, phrases and linguistic terms that you will come across. They are often used to succinctly paint a picture of how well the project is progressing, as well as identifying issues that require a remedy. Getting to know what they are and what they stand for is essential for effective project leaders at all levels. Close Your browser does not support iframes.
