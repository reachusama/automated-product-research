Curriculum & Teaching Support,AI lesson plan generator,TeachMateAI - Can AI save teachers time?,https://www.votesforschools.com/blog/teachmate-ai-for-teachers/,com,UK,16 May 2023 TeachMateAI,,,teachers,,,"TeachMateAI - Can AI save teachers time? Want to try our resources? Sign up for our 14-Day Free Trial 16 May 2023 TeachMateAI - Can AI save teachers time? We trialled the new AI platform taking education by storm Most of us know Mr. P by now - from his stints on breakfast TV to his hilarious Mrs May readings on Facebook. However, in recent weeks Mr P has moved on to a new venture… one that promises to help all teachers get their Netflix time back by helping them cut their workload. You can hear Mr P's own introduction to the platform on his Youtube channel: A Step-By-Step Tutorial of TeachMateAI by Mr P ICT We trialled Mr P’s new TeachMateA i to see if it really can save teachers time - and wrote all about the experience. First Impressions My initial impressions were that I was blown away by the sheer number of tools available and - if they all worked as I hoped they would - the amount of time this could save me. Here's just a glance at some of the tools under the 'Teacher Tools' tab: For most of us, it's currently reports season and the question running through my mind is whether I can get my reports written before May half term, or if I'll be taking my laptop away on holiday, so this seemed the best place to start. How to write reports in less than a day: First: a disclaimer. I am not completely new to using AI programmes. Like many, I have played around with Chat GPT , asking it questions like ""Why is my Google Spreadsheet not working"" and ""Make me an easy workout plan that will help with back pain."" From this, I've realised that ChatGPT has been known to spit out quite formal, robotic texts, which does not fit with my chatty style of report writing. So, I wasn't starting hopeful. Fortunately, TeachMate have got this sussed. To use the tool, simply input the name of the pupil, the subject you want the report to be about, the length of the report, and choose between formal and informal writing style. Then you're asked to pop a few notes about the pupil's strengths and weaknesses before you generate your report. I asked for a quick report to be written about my colleague, Kate, which you can see below: Kate is an absolute joy to have in our English class! She constantly dazzles us with her boundless imagination and talent for storytelling . Her passion for drama is infectious and she brings a lot of energy to the classroom. On occasion, Kate can become quite chatty during lessons , which sometimes distracts herself and others in class. Nonetheless, she has made significant improvements in this area and continues to work on being more aware of her talking. Overall, Kate's enthusiasm and creativity make her a valuable member of our class and we look forward to seeing her progress in the future. This tool is a time saver - there's no doubt in my mind - but it also allows me to spend my time on the things that matter - making sure reports are personalised to each student, instead of applying a best-fit copy paste job across the board (no judgement here. Writing reports is tough). Looking for lessons about AI & Technology? Start your free trial Can it write curriculum based reports? In the Primary school that I worked in, we pretty much wrote two reports for each subject: one relating to the pupil, and another relating to their development in line with curriculum aims. TeachMateAi have not forgotten this. Their second tool is a Curriculum Report Writer - where you can choose the curriculum you use (pictured). This tool is as simple as the previous one - input in the topics covered and wait for AI to put together your report. For this one, I tried out using just 60 words, linked to the Year 4 maths curriculum. You can see what it came up with below: Kate has made brilliant progress in Maths since the beginning of Year 4. She has mastered fractions, times tables, multiplication, division, shape and space, addition and subtraction . Kate is confident in her abilities and consistently participates in class discussions with ease. She is always willing to help her peers and shows excellent problem-solving skills. Kate is an asset to the class and should be commended for her relentless effort While this works perfectly for the pupils that have mastered the curriculum , it would obviously need some editing for those who have struggled in certain areas, or are ""working towards"" on a curriculum level (though watch this space, as I get the feeling the TeachMateAi team are hot on updating and upgrading their platform every week). What else can TeachMateAi do? Having covered the most pressing question for teachers during May, I then moved on to see what else TeachMateAi could help me with. By the time it came to testing out their Letter Writing, I was starting to get the hang of how TeachMateAi works... and starting to have a little fun with it. You can see one of many letters I produced below: It's good at admin... but can it help me teach? By now, I'd realised that this platform is going to be revolutionary for a lot of those admin tasks that eat up a lot of time. The number of tools is huge, including policy & IEP writers, risk assessments, permission slips, and performance management targets - all tools that will help teachers take back control and - well- actually be able to teach. However, the platform also boasts some hopeful teaching aides, such as a slides generator, lesson planner and progression document, which were next in line to try. Teacher Tools vs Classroom Tools At the time of writing (May 2023), TeachMateAi boasts 24 Teacher Tools (some of which we've just covered) & a further whopping 41 Classroom Tools. Choosing just 3 to review proved tricky, but I've given it my best shot & tried to choose ones that cover a variety of curriculum areas. You can also see all of their current classroom tools in the image below: Worksheet Generator This one sounds exciting from the off - could this mean finally getting rid of my Twinkl Teacher Subscription? As I'd already tried out the first few tools using my comfortable 2014 National Curriculum for primary, I decided to branch out about for this tool and choose a line from the KS3 National Curriculum to see what I could make. Here's the bulletpoint I chose: knowing how language, including figurative language, vocabulary choice, grammar, text structure and organisational features, presents meaning - The National Curriculum, 2014, English programmes of study: key stage 3 And from that, the Learning Objective I created: I can use figurative language to present meaning (Year 9) I've included a picture below to show you the results, as I'm not sure how to sum them up. Yes, you'll probably need to change the font to something your school likes, and maybe you'll want to chop and change an activity - but a worksheet with 5 activities (and an extension task, not shown) in less than 60 seconds is a win for any teacher. Flashcard Generator As I said before, I trained and taught as a primary school teacher in England, using the NC14. However, for the sake of this article, I knew I needed to test some of the other curriculum areas to show TeachMateAi's full capabilities. With that in mind, here are some flashcards I created using The Curriculum for Excellence (Scotland) * on Catholic Christianity (subject), on the Son of God (topic) for a P3 class. *Fortunately, TeachMateAi gave me a little summary to teach me more about the Curriculum for Excellence, writing that ""In P3, the main learning objectives for the topic of Son of God in Catholic Christianity include developing an understanding of the life and teachings of Jesus, as well as exploring the central beliefs and practices of the Catholic Church."" Content-wise, these seem good. Visually, as a primary teacher, I feel like we've gotten used to images or colours, but for the speed that these were made in- and the ease of downloading them (into a word doc) and printing, I can forgo the pretty images. Maths Repetitive Practice With literacy skills & a bit of history/RE covered, I next moved on to a maths tool - using the following prompts: Using just 5 words, here's the output I got. Ranging from simple algebra to ones that could be used as a brain test in a newspaper. Like before, these can also be downloaded as a Word Document, making them easy to print off and use straight away. And, of course, the options are endless - times table practice for primary, word problems - anything. Differentiate Text For my last test of TeachMateAi, I decided to test out their differentiated text tool. Teaching in a multicultural area of London, I often taught children with English as a second language (EAL) who found it difficult to access class texts. With this in mind, I took the opening of C.S. Lewis' infamous The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe and asked TeachMateAi to make it accessible for a Year 2 reading ability. You can see the inputted and outputted text below: What else do I need to know? So far, I've only really told you about a few specific tools that I've tested out of the near 100 available tools, so the first thing to know is that there is a lot more this Ai can do to help you plan, teach, complete admin and cut your workload.There are also more and more tools being created each week, with 39 extra tools marked as ""coming soon"" (including writing feedback and exam marking, which sound exciting). You should also know that AI is not instant - I timed the response time TeachMateAi took to give me an output and it came out on average of 20 seconds. Still, 20 seconds to create a worksheet or write a report is a zillion times quicker than it would've taken me to do myself. Also, there are a few tools that I wasn't absolutely in love with - for example, while the lesson plan generator gave an amazing rationale of how the outputted (in 20 seconds!) lesson met a multitude of curriculum areas, and made for a great lesson, when I used the same descriptions in the Lesson Slides Generator tool, I was given a slightly different set of slides. This said, the Lesson Slides Generator also came up with it's own lesson plan, matching the slides, so I guess the two aren't made to be used together. In retrospect, I'd probably save the lesson plan generator for helping me plan a lesson for an observation (with it's great rationale and curriculum links), and the Slides Generator as an every day tool to create a starter Powerpoint for my lessons. It's also worth noting that the Slides Generator creates text based slides. I imagine this works well for KS3+ lessons, but not so well for a KS1 teacher trying to explain halves and quarters for a shape. So, like most things, some tools will work brilliantly and save you time, and others won't be of use to you, depending on your role within a school. Lastly, the team at TeachMateAi seem incredibly helpful. They responded to my email asking if I could use their platform on the same day, and answered any follow-up questions I had immediately. Through the platform you can report bugs and issues, and also suggest a tool that you would like to see, meaning that this platform is only set to get better and better. Is it free? If you've made it this far, you're probably invested the potential of this tool and the jobs it could cut out for you. The good news is, you can start accessing some of the tools for free, including 5 free report outputs and the Maths starter Questions tool. If full access is what you're after, TeachMateAi is priced well, at £6.99 per month for individual use, or £72 for the year. There are also pricing models available for whole school access, such as £395 for 10 users - making it less than £40 a year. I asked some of my teacher-friends whether they would pay for it's use and the responses were split - while we all agreed that this tool has the potential to cut workload immensely, it wasn't long before the wider debate of whether teachers should pay out of their own pocket for subscriptions and resources came about. That's for you to decide. But it could be worth speaking to your SLT about... ------- Amy was a primary school teacher for four years before joining VotesforSchools . She remembers Sunday planning sessions and trying to make a wealth of resources each week, so she reached out to TeachMateAi and asked if she could trial their platform and share it with VotesforSchools' audience. share Previous SMSC in Education: Everything you need to know Last updated 9th July, 2024 by Admin

Highs and lows of Edtech The most recent Department for Education (DfE) ‘Technology in Schools’ survey showed a significant majority of teachers (87%) use some form of tech during their lessons. This figure has never been so high and represents the gradual blurring of lines between what is traditional ‘education’ and what is ‘edtech’.

Don’t take my word for it, see what our School Leaders say… I COULD NOT RECOMMEND SLT AI HIGHLY ENOUGH SLT AI has honestly revolutionised my workload! The number of options available in the tools section is amazing, particularly the personnel section which saves me hours of time. I also love the ‘chat now’ function which refines and edits my communication but maintains my tone of voice- it’s amazing. I could not recommend the SLT AI highly enough. Thank you so much! Millie Brook Headteacher – Carlton Primary School OUTSTANDING TIME SAVER! An outstanding time saver and guide. James Houston Principal – Newton Group HONESTLY CHANGED MY LIFE I just wanted to say what a FANTASTIC tool your product is! As a busy headteacher, I sometimes feel ‘trapped’ in my office writing responses to emails, EHCP consultations, policies or plans and your product has saved me SO much time! This may sound overdramatic but it honestly has changed my life! Sarah Bond Headteacher – Eccleston Lane Ends Primary School GROUNDBREAKING SUPPORT FOR BUSY SCHOOL LEADERS SLT AI is artificial intelligence at its best, providing groundbreaking support for busy school leaders, saving them time and producing draft documents with comprehensive, useful and highly focused content. SLT AI is a gamechanger and should be available to all education leaders. The Ofsted deep dives, policy helper and interview questions have been so useful, and the general chat function produces letters and documents from a few words. The cost of SLT AI is very reasonable and will be saved within the first couple of weeks of use. Andrew Berry CEO – Tilian Partnership MASSIVE TIME SAVER! It is early days for us in using SLT AI, however so far it has proven to be a massive time saver, and really appropriate for our needs. What has been most impressive is the customer care and how responsive the team is when you have a question or request. There is much more for us to discover, but I would definitely recommend! Tanya Moran Executive Headteacher – Abingdon House School SAVES TIME AND IS PROFESSIONAL SLT AI is an excellent resource which responds well to the many faceted role of leaders. It is very easy to use, with a range of resources and if something isn’t there then you can ask and something will be designed to suit you. Absolutely love this tool – saves time and is professional. Gill Humphriss Headteacher – Stratford Upon Avon Primary School NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING! The Senior Leaders AI software is an exceptional tool that has the potential to transform the amount of time senior leaders spend on paper based activities. The Senior Leaders AI software is nothing short of amazing. It’s intuitive interface and user-friendly design make it an ease to use. With just a few clicks, leaders can effortlessly create the reports and information they need, allowing them to focus their time and energy on what truly matters. One of the most impressive aspects of the Senior Leaders AI software is that it is ever-evolving. It adapts to the changing needs and requirements of schools, ensuring that leaders have access to the latest features and capabilities. This commitment to continuous improvement ensures that the software is a must-have for senior leaders. Phil Kyriacou Head Teacher – Tudor Court Primary School AMAZING TOOL FOR PRIORITIES! SLT AI is an amazing tool. I use it to give me a starting platform for jobs I have been avoiding. As a result I am ticking things off my to do list in less time, allowing me to focus on other priorities. As a trust we have requested additional tools which have undoubtedly helped our ten headteachers in getting their ideas onto paper. I thoroughly recommend, my only hesitation for those who think it will be a miracle worker is… it is only as good as the information you put in, however spending time on adding detail in the school information section is well worth it. Louise Clark Chief Improvement Officer – The Tilian Partnership YOU NEED THIS TOOL! Oh my gosh! You need this tool in your life. As a headteacher, I no longer have to face the stress and pain of a blank page or the confusion and stress of staring blankly while I think of what to do next or how to start. SLT AI does not do the work for you, but it does help you start the work. Anthony Evans Headteacher – St Michael’s Primary Bournemouth CAN’T THANK YOU ENOUGH I had a full days work to do today on Deep Dives …. this tool literally cut my workload down to 1 hour – can’t thank you enough! Chris Dyson Deputy CEO – Create Partnership Trust ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! This is absolutely amazing! I cannot believe how quickly I can get answers for questions! What a brilliant, well thought out tool! Laura Snowdon Head of School – Red Hall Primary School 100% EASIER AND QUICKER! It has been a game changer – in terms of saving time. Sometimes finding the right words for an email, especially those difficult emails takes up so much brain space but since using SLT AI this admin task became 100% easier and quicker. Kerry O'Doherty Assistant Head Teacher – Hackbridge Primary School FINISHED IN MINUTES! SLT AI provided a well-structured letter in response to a parent concern. It was more objective and empathetic than I would have written myself, given the nature of the views expressed by the parent. It was very detailed and with a few editing tweaks, finished in minutes. Jo Badge Head Teacher – Catherine Junior School CANNOT RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH! Despite only using SLT AI for a matter of weeks, we are finding it very useful. In particular for looking at strengths and areas for improvement on data sets we are using for an upcoming international inspection. 

Craig who runs SLT AI has been amazingly helpful in trying to understand the needs of British International schools as well as UK schools and will respond to emails and feature requests often within a matter of hours rather than days. He is looking at the inspection framework from international inspectors and what we need to produce for them, rather like an Ofsted inspection in the UK. 
I cannot recommend it enough and think it will help save SLT time so they can focus on the more face to face aspects of your schools! Sarah Green Head Teacher – St. Christopher’s International School, Malaysia HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL SCHOOL LEADERS! We have been using SLT AI since September and it has been money well spent. It has been a game changer for us as a senior leadership team and is a really useful tool for us to have. There are so many tools to be used within SLT AI and has saved our team so much time. To be able to download into Word and then alter documents allows us to still have the flexibility of ensuring you can hear our voice in the written word! I would highly recommend SLT AI to all school leaders. Jen Taylor Deputy Head Teacher – Longshaw Junior School A QUANTUM SHIFT IN THE EDUCATION PARADIGM!

Even if you only used half the tools available, it is money well spent! Jamie Barry Head Teacher – Yew Tree Primary School CLARIFIES THINKING! SLT AI has been of great help to me in the way it clarifies my thinking on decisions using the chat tool. I also make a lot of use of the action planning features as a starting point to school development planning. The responsiveness of the designers is fantastic and they have added to the AI knowledge base following requests for support with Catholic Inspectorate documentation. Richard Sanderson Headteacher – St Osmund’s Catholic Primary School FIGHT BACK FOR SENIOR LEADERS! A fight back for senior leaders! Very helpful in shaping key school documents! Alex Kolb Headteacher – Coughton CofE Primary School REALLY BRING DOWN MY WORKLOAD I have found that with just a few dabbles SLT AI has already saved me time. Think of your school development plan and the annual headache that it presents. You have your priorities and objectives but the empty table needs filling with actions and these should be evidence based. This is where SLT AI has been so helpful! It gave me a collection of term by term evidence informed actions and outcomes that served as a first draft for my SDP. I could take this to leaders to further refine and debate as opposed to starting with a blank page. I am excited to see the tool grow as Craig responds to feedback and suggestions. This will really bring down my workload burden and allow space for time with people and creativity in the future. Anthony Evans Head Teacher – St Michael’s Primary I LOVE IT! I have found SLT AI very helpful in my role, it saves so much time and provides details it would take me ages to search for via the usual channels, I love it!

Having a software device that not only saves time but also produces work that is articulate and relevant is much needed!

I would recommend anyone who is interested to contact Craig-he has been incredibly helpful and really knows what leaders need to make their jobs that little bit easier! Matt Harris Senior Vice Principal – Hugh Christie School SLT AI’S SPEED AND ACCURACY IS INCREDIBLE! SLT AI is a game changer! It has huge potential to give valuable time back to busy members of school leadership teams by rapidly producing draft reports that can be quickly adapted. SLT AI’s speed and accuracy is incredible, and it can answer almost any question/task you give it to do. Andy Calvery Assistant Head Teacher – Ilkley Grammar School SLT AI IS UNIQUE SLT AI is a really helpful tool which is continually improving as a way to support school leaders. Finding ways to give SLT time back is like an answer to all our prayers and helps us to focus on the things that make the biggest difference! Making the most of technology helps us all work smarter.

By using AI-powered tools like adaptive learning platforms or intelligent tutoring systems, teachers can tailor instruction to each student's individual needs and preferences. This can help students learn at their own pace, focus on areas where they need additional support, and stay motivated throughout their learning journey. Data-Driven Decision Making AI technology enables teachers to gather valuable insights from student data that can inform instructional decisions and interventions. Tools like Brightspace Insights or Google Classroom analytics provide real-time data on student performance, engagement levels, attendance records, and more. By analysing this data, teachers can identify patterns or trends that may indicate areas for improvement or additional support needed for certain students. This data-driven approach allows teachers to tailor their lessons to meet the diverse needs of the students effectively. Virtual Assistants Integrating virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant into your classroom can enhance productivity and efficiency. These voice-activated AI tools can help answer students' questions, set reminders for assignments or deadlines, schedule appointments, and even deliver educational content through interactive quizzes or games. By incorporating virtual assistants into your teaching routine, you can create a more interactive and engaging learning experience for your students. Automation of Administrative Tasks Teachers are often burdened with administrative tasks that take time away from actual teaching and lesson planning. AI can help streamline these tasks by automating processes such as grading assignments, generating reports on student progress, or scheduling parent-teacher conferences. By offloading these routine tasks to AI-powered tools, teachers can free up more time to focus on building relationships with students, designing engaging lessons, and providing individualized support where needed. Using AI for school reports TeachMateAI – this tool will save you hours in report writing.

Pie Corbett Ultimate KS2 Fiction Collection Download Now Primary English Lots of educators are already using AI in education to save time and automate some of the duller aspects of the job. (Report writing, anyone?) In fact, according to the survey tool Teacher Tapp, four in ten teachers are already using AI in their schoolwork. Educational technologist and former deputy headteacher, Mel Parker , predicts that with budget cuts and teacher shortages, AI in 2024 will become “an essential tool to support teachers in their day-to-day role”. Here’s how you can use AI in your classroom to save time and improve your teaching… Table of Contents Time-saving AI teaching resources Example of teachers using AI in lessons Podcasts about AI in education How to create a digital strategy that embraces generative AI Example ChatGPT command prompts to try Time-saving AI teaching resources Lyndsey Stuttard sets out some practical and potentially effective uses for AI within your classroom… Not all schools will benefit from using AI. For many, there can be multiple, much more pressing issues to consider. However, if you have the capacity, try designating a member of staff to research possible AI applications within the context of your school’s needs. Here’s a few ideas to get you started… Discover alternative teaching perspectives Many teachers can feel out of their comfort zone when approaching new themes as part of their school curriculum and syllabus planning. For example, at our school, teachers were tasked with rewriting the entire Lower School curriculum to ensure that each unit included a theme from the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. In an instance like this, you can use AI tools in order to highlight anything you may have missed. By entering the new criteria and unit into ChatGPT, you can quickly see if there are any additional topics that might be relevant for specific age groups, for example. Provide real-time learning feedback Sadly, we’re not always able to provide as much feedback as we’d like for homework or assignments. The tool Quizlet helps students practise their vocabulary and make flashcards. Quizlet’s Chat Robot tests students on the meaning of a term, and if a student submits an incorrect answer, that answer is analysed. Instant feedback is then provided to explain the term in more detail and help the student understand where they may have gone wrong. Support reading comprehension Another recent addition to Quizlet is a set of AI features aimed at making vocabulary learning more accessible and engaging. Via the app’s Magic Notes tool , students can insert longer articles into Quizlet and receive a summary or outline of the key points. This saves teachers time while supporting students who might struggle with comprehension tasks. Create revision plans AI tools can be highly beneficial for students who find it difficult to structure their own learning. Students can use ChatGPT to create workflows, study strategies and even revision plans that work for them, making a potentially overwhelming task much more manageable. Tap into unfamiliar topics AI can aid teachers in delving into new, hitherto unfamiliar teaching topics. We sought to incorporate the aforementioned Sustainable Development Goals into our curriculum, but are by no means experts in each of the Goals. How, for example, should we make gender equality more accessible to a five-year-old? AI tools can serve teachers as helpful ‘ideas generators’ by providing an introduction to a topic and recommending an age-appropriate learning activity, or by suggesting which resources could best facilitate said learning. Lyndsey Stuttard is a digital teaching and learning specialist at ACS International School Cobham . 13 ways ChatGPT can reduce teacher workload This free guide from Dan Fitzpatrick covers using ChatGPT to: Mark work Provide feedback Model answers Create a unit of work or lesson plan Create questions/lesson booklets Make a presentation Write reports and parents’ evening notes Create a curriculum intent document Dan also offers a ChatGPT Survival Kit video course . AI lesson plan generators Picture this: no more late nights drowning in paperwork. Instead, just a trusty assistant crafting lesson plans at the speed of light. Say goodbye to monotony and hello to more coffee breaks with the new raft of AI lesson plan generators that are popping up around the internet. One such example is Oak AI Experiments , which is supported by a £2 million investment from the government. This free tool allows you to: create and refine keywords share common misconceptions outline essential learning objectives build an introductory and exit quiz Here we’ve asked it to generate a KS2 history lesson under the title, ‘What do we really know about the Vikings?’. Beware though, as Daisy Christodoulou points out, AI is prone to making factual errors . For this reason, it’s important to check the outputs they generate. Why not give it a go yourself? Cheers to stress-free planning! You can also experiment with generating quizzes for your students. The AI-driven tool generates answers and distractors in a format that you can share or export. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak commented on these AI tools, saying: “Oak National Academy’s work to harness AI to free up the workload for teachers is a perfect example of the revolutionary benefits this technology can bring.” AI tools for school leaders Former headteacher Craig McKee has created SLT AI to reduce the workload of senior leaders in schools. Unlike ChatGPT, this model has been trained on the latest information from the DfE, EEF and Ofsted. This means you should get an informed response based on the information it has been given. Some of the tools it offers include: Evidence-based responses on all things school improvement Personalised behaviour plans for pupils Bid writing applications Deep dive preparation Suggested points and wording for difficult conversations Help with interview questions and job adverts Read more from founder Craig McKee below . AI school report writers Imagine if you could write all your school reports in a few hours, rather than the process dragging on for several weeks? Tools such as TeachMateAI promise to help you do this. In fact, one primary teacher reported that the tool has reduced her report writing to “4-5 hours, maximum.” This particular website, built by teaching and tech experts including Mr P , can also help you to: generate slideshows write comprehension and model texts generate maths word problems plan your lessons Another website offering a similar service is Real Fast Reports . Here’s an example of how it transfers a set of brief bullet points into a report – meaning you can generate each one in just one to two minutes. AI design tools from Canva Canva, the online graphic design tool, has recently launched Classroom Magic , a suite of AI tools for the classroom. This includes Magic Write, which allows you to generate a first draft, reword complex content or summarise text. Meanwhile, Magic Animate helps you to turn classroom materials into captivating videos and presentations in an instant. Magic Grab allows you to grab the text from, for example, a photo of a whiteboard or a paper-based resource, without having to rewrite it manually. Magic Switch means you can reformat teaching materials instantly. So, for example, you can turn a presentation into a summary document or a whiteboard of ideas into a presentation. Teacher’s prompt guide to ChatGPT This Teacher’s Prompt Guide to ChatGPT will teach you how to effectively incorporate ChatGPT into your teaching practice and make the most of its capabilities. The guide covers generating prompts that will: Encourage students to think critically and solve problems Encourage students to t hink about their learning process and progress Help teachers improve their skills in using data effectively Produce open-ended questions that align with the learning intentions and success criteria of your unit of work Help you get to know students’ interests, strengths attitudes towards learning, and aspirations Analyse the effectiveness of different teaching strategies Also check out this list of the best ChatGPT prompts for teachers .

Just imagine what this will be capable of for any historical context. pic.twitter.com/vgKvYncnlC — Tom Rogers (@RogersHistory) February 15, 2024 Podcasts about AI in education In this episode of The Edtech Podcast , Nina Huntemann and Lord Jim Knight attempt to understand how best to cut through the white noise surrounding AI’s hype, misinformation, exaggeration and marketing, and determine just how positive for education AI can be if done responsibly. Dive into the hot topic of AI in education by listening to a podcast with a data and AI specialist who works at Google Cloud. The podcast covers: the convenience technology and AI can bring to the sector the importance of creating digital learning opportunities for young people how to give teachers the confidence to use technology in the classroom how to focus on the positives of technology safeguarding issues the ethical and legal issues surrounding new technologies More useful resources DfE policy paper – Generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education The AI Educator Sunday newsletter A list of AI educator tools from The AI Educator How to create a digital strategy that embraces generative AI Al Kingsley, multi academy trust chair and group CEO of NetSupport , discusses the importance of adapting your strategy to take AI into consideration… Generative AI has undoubtedly seen meteoric growth recently. Conversations in the education sector regarding the potential threats and opportunities have increased in tandem with these technological developments. Although exciting potential opportunities beckon, concerns are also being – rightfully – raised by educators who feel overwhelmed by the growing use of this new technology. Already in use However, a more pragmatic view is needed. The reality is that schools have been making the most of the capabilities of non-generative AI for years. Personalised learning tools and pathways that support student learning are a great example of this. So are management information systems tools used by leadership and administrative teams to analyse and understand issues such as attendance and attainment. AI has therefore already been in use (albeit to varying degrees) in schools across the country, cutting teacher workload, informing decisions made by leaders and helping students to learn. Taking this view, there is less need to feel daunted by the growing use of generative AI. This technology, in one form or another, has been present in schools for a while – and similar approaches can be taken. The pillars of digital strategies will remain largely unchanged in the face of generative AI. However, adaptations will of course be needed. Five key considerations for integrating new technological resources Having clarity on the educational purpose, intended use and purported benefits of any tool is critical, whether or not it’s AI-based. The adoption of technology is not a race. School leaders should not feel pressure to begin using any software simply for the sake of appearing ‘cutting edge’. Like all technology, some solutions will build up credible evidence of their efficacy over time. Others will be rightly discounted. Regular re-evaluation to measure tangible impacts will ensure the tool your school selects is the right one. Data protection and security should remain a priority; a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) will identify any potential risks. Is the tool programme-agnostic? How will it integrate with pre-existing systems and solutions already in use? This will be crucial in evaluating the potential long-term usage and benefits of new resources. Implement a clear, comprehensive usage policy for generative AI resources. Transparency should be a key element of this policy. Make it clear where AI is being used and what for – for instance, acknowledging the role of AI in the creation of any resources used by teachers. Supporting staff with thorough initial training and CPD opportunities, so they can confidently and efficiently use these tools. Without current and regular CPD, any technological resources risk becoming burdens; particularly in the current landscape of rapid innovation. Students using AI In addition to the above, it will be essential for educators to understand how their students are already using generative AI. Recent research from the charity Internet Matters found that 54 per cent of children use generative AI tools for their schoolwork and homework. Despite this, 60 per cent of schools have not spoken to their students regarding the use of AI in this manner. Remaining up-to-date with these trends can be tricky. However, edtech vendors and education community forums often share invaluable insights in this regard. The advent of AI also reinforces the importance and value of the human-to-human dynamic in the learning journey. The curriculum, and indeed our methods of teaching and assessment, will undoubtedly need to adapt in order to keep pace with the burgeoning AI era. As AI continues to grow in capability, the balance in education is likely to shift further away from pure knowledge-building. It will move towards the impartment of relevant skills. To keep pace with the integration of AI into many aspects of our every day, learners must be equipped with the ability to analyse and question the information in front of them, determining how to best utilise and apply knowledge. Students’ ability to thrive in tomorrow’s world (and workforce) will depend on how educators can help their students in this regard. Example ChatGPT command prompts to try 1. Lesson preparation and administration You can create more time for yourself by enlisting the help of ChatGPT for tasks such as lesson plans, creating resources, marking work and analysing data. Example prompt: Plan a 60 minute lesson on glaciation for a Year 7 mixed ability class 2. The generation of specific learning pathways Counter the tendency towards ‘one size fits all’ teacher training by focusing your professional development on specific areas of need. Example prompt: I am an ECT struggling with management of low-level behavioural issues. Can you suggest some strategies to move forward? 3. Streamlining research Use ChatGPT to summarise articles before reading them, so that you can acquire better insights into whether or not they’re relevant to the field you’re researching. Example prompt: Summarise Luckin, Rose (2020) ‘AI in education will help us understand how we think’ 4. Helping you read more widely ChatGPT can be used to recommend wider reading around a particular area of need, or just broad topics that you happen to be interested in. Example prompt: Suggest key texts on AI in education 5. Critiquing your teaching Another possible use for ChatGPT is to gauge the likely effectiveness of your lesson planning; you can then use its findings to help you better reflect on your practice. Example prompt: I plan to do a group task with a mixed-ability Year 8 class. What might the limitations of this approach be?

This means that: There may be bugs, usability and compatibility issues, although it has been tested with major browsers Not all features intended for the final release are included Requirements This has been tested with the following web browsers. This is not to say that it is entirely fully tested and bug-free. (It's an alpha release!) Windows/Google Chrome 55 Windows/Firefox 50.1.0 Windows/Edge 38.14393 How to use How do I use this? Tutorial video to be released late Jan/Feb 2017). Tips Don't put in grade numbers, put in letters, otherwise strange sorting can happen (unless you're only using numbers 0-9, or appropriately zero-filling, e.g. 01, 02...10, 11, it'll work) Navigate the cells in the list of people with tab/shift+tab, up/down arrow keys. Future features Integration with Google Drive and OneDrive Change settings, e.g. the order of 'chair discovery' when positioning people. Misc. It always starts to position people from the bottom left, but if it finds a 'chair', it looks for adjacent chairs in the order of right, up, left, down. Do not refresh the web page. If you do, the data disappears.

Curriculum & Teaching Support,AI lesson plan generator,10 Best AI tools for TEFL teachers & how to use them in 2025,https://tefl-iberia.com/blog/best-ai-tools-for-tefl-teachers/,com,UK,10 Best AI tools for TEFL teachers,,2025 10 ,"students, teachers",,chatbot,"10 Best AI tools for TEFL teachers & how to use them in 2025 10 Best AI tools for TEFL teachers and how to use them Ryan Osborne • April, 29 2024 Share: We’ve seen a seismic growth in the power and influence of Artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years. For teachers, the fear is that AI is now so powerful, that it could soon make their jobs redundant. Is this the end of teaching as we know it? We say no. We’d like to offer an alternative take – one where teachers, specifically TEFL teachers, use AI tools to complement their lessons, creating an immersive and personalised learning experience like never before. If harnessed in the right way, today’s AI-powered tools can be used for everything from automating administrative tasks and creating dynamic lesson plans, to pinpointing learning gaps and creating virtual learning environments. And AI is constantly evolving, with new tools emerging all the time. The possibilities are seemingly endless. So, what are the 10 best AI tools for TEFL teachers? Let’s take a look. 1. Chat GPT The most popular AI tool out there, Chat GPT can be used for just about any creative task you can think of. For teachers, it’s one of the most useful AI tools available, with so many uses. Chat GPT can serve as a virtual teaching assistant for TEFL teachers, complementing teaching efforts by answering questions during class, assigning homework, creating lesson plans and generating a rubric to help evaluate the quality of students’ work. Another powerful feature is conversation sharing. Teachers can create a conversation with a chat bot, setting the difficulty level, subject and the AI’s conversational style, then let students carry on the conversation. They can then share this conversation with the teacher, who can provide feedback. Other excellent AI-based virtual teaching assistants are Microsoft Copilot and ClassPoint . 2. Quizgecko Quizzes are a great way to engage students in the classroom and offer immediate feedback, giving students an idea of areas they need to improve. The thing is, creating a quiz yourself can be time-consuming and using a pre-existing quiz doesn’t allow you to tailor the themes to your students’ interests. That’s why AI-based quiz and assessment generators are so effective. TEFL teachers can use AI tools like Quizgecko to create quizzes and tests in an instant. You can turn any text, YouTube video or webpage into a quiz with just a few clicks. Other good AI quiz generators that teachers can use include Quizizz and QuestionWell 3. Exact Path An excellent analytical platform that can be used by all types of teachers, Exact Path can be used to ascertain students strengths and weaknesses. This AI tool for teachers differentiates subjects and activities for your students, utilising adaptive assessments to pinpoint knowledge gaps and provide a personalised learning path Let’s say one of your students is struggling with a certain theme – the past continuous, for example. The tool can create vocabulary and speaking exercises, with open-ended prompts, perfectly tailored to address the specific needs of the student. Another quality AI platform that allows you to assess your students’ learning and meet their individual needs is ClassPoint . These tools are some of the best AI tools for teachers in smaller groups or one-to-one teaching scenarios and can significantly enhance the effectiveness of personalised learning. 4. Canva Another wonderful AI app, Canva has many different uses. It can be used to create any type of visually appealing educational content, such as whiteboards, documents or presentations. The platform also comes with a dedicated AI text-to-image generator, Canva Magic Write, which can inspire the creativity of your students, providing creative ideas for your lessons. It can be used to generate lesson plans, summarise concepts in an engaging, easy to understand way. Canva can also be used to create social media posts, videos, posters and photo collages to keep your students engaged. Good alternatives include VistaCreate and Visme 5. Zapier Not every teacher's task is about inspiring students with incredibly creative content and amazing imagery. A lot of a teacher’s time is taken up dealing with less than fun admin side of things. But it doesn’t have to be. There are now some excellent AI tools out there like Zapier that can effectively streamline administrative work, reducing the amount of time spent on tasks like collecting and organising student data or sending out email reminders. As a TEFL teacher, you can use these automation tools to take care of tasks across all platforms, giving you more time to focus on teaching, interacting with and inspiring your students. 6. Story AI The best AI tools for TEFL teachers can also make learning more exciting, engaging and relatable by generating compelling stories and narratives. The likes of Story AI can generate stories based around your students’ interests. All you need to do is choose certain parameters, including specific genres, characters, locations, endings, then the tool will generate the story. These stories can help language learners pick up grammar and syntax in a natural way, while creating vivid context to enable students to make language connections and improve vocabulary. Another great AI tool for TEFL teachers who specialise in teaching young learners is Storywizard . 7. Duolingo Some of the best AI tools for TEFL teachers are platforms that students often use for self learning. These AI-powered adaptive learning platforms, of which Duolingo is the most popular, enable students to personalise their language learning. Teachers should take advantage of the fact that most students are already familiar with platforms like Duolingo. These platforms use data-driven algorithms to provide tailored recommendations specific to students’ needs. Duolingo can be seamlessly integrated into the classroom. You can create and share assignments, give awards, set progress quizzes and incorporate remote learning. Other excellent adaptive learning platforms powered by AI include Babbel and Memrise . 8. DeepL Just as maths students use calculators and creative writing students use a dictionary or thesaurus, language learners will need an effective translator when learning in class. They don’t get better than DeepL , an AI-powered platform that can instantly translate texts and full document files. TEFL teachers can also use this AI-based tool to facilitate in-class communication and create materials, while supporting the learning journey of students from all over the world. Other great AI-based translators include Quillbot and Smartcat . 9. Winston AI We’ve listed some of the best AI tools for TEFL teachers above. But what about the potential for students to misuse the technology, utilising it to help them cheat on assignments? Well, in this instance, it’s time to fight fire with fire. There are now AI tools available that can help teachers detect plagiarism and ensure academic integrity. The likes of Winston AI can scan students’ work to detect instances of academic misconduct, with accuracy levels of around 99%. Popular AI tools like Grammarly and Originality AI can also be used to check for plagiarism. 10 Mondly VR Finally, a foray into the virtual world of language learning. Mondly VR is the world’s first language learning experience with chatbot and speech recognition, immersing students in real world situations. Students get the chance to practice conversations in realistic scenarios, with instant feedback on pronunciation to help them build the confidence to speak new languages in real life. TEFL teachers can harness this AI tool to provide authentic simulations, putting students into virtual travel scenarios and simulating typical experiences and conversations. Alternative include Language Lab and ImmerseMe . Popular Posts Can you study in Spain with a digital nomad visa?

Curriculum & Teaching Support,AI lesson plan generator,"An Interview With Jon Chippindall, CEO And Co-founder Of TeachMate.AI",https://hwrkmagazine.co.uk/interview-teachmate-ai/,uk,UK,12 July 2024 0 Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LinkedIn Email An Interview With Jon Chippindall,,,"students, teachers",,,"An Interview With Jon Chippindall, CEO And Co-founder Of TeachMate.AI In Features An Interview With Jon Chippindall, CEO And Co-founder Of TeachMate.AI By Rachel Arthur 12 July 2024 0 Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LinkedIn Email An Interview With Jon Chippindall, CEO And Co-founder Of TeachMate.AI By Rachel Arthur This week I had the pleasure of catching up with Jon Chippindall CEO and co-founder of TeachMateAI. We had an insightful conversation all about AI in education and what impact it is having in the classroom… Rachel Arthur: So, let’s kick things off! How would you like to introduce yourself? Jon Chippindall: I’m Jon Chippindall, the CEO and Co-founder of TeachMateAI. It’s a bit of a fancy title, but basically, I handle everything from emails to steering the company’s direction. Oh, and I’ve been teaching primary school in Manchester for over a decade, and yep, I still teach! Rachel Arthur: That’s quite the resume! So, TeachMateAI, is it an app, a website, what are we calling it? Jon Chippindall: Good question! It’s more like a platform, an AI platform designed specifically for teachers which is accessed online. Rachel Arthur: Let’s break it down for those who might not be familiar. Can you give a brief explanation of what AI is for those reading this who may have heard a lot about AI but not actually understand what it is? Jon Chippindall: Absolutely! About 18 months ago, AI, particularly generative AI, really started making waves. Before that, AI was mostly about classifying things, like identifying if something’s a muffin or a Chihuahua. But now, it’s gotten way more powerful. We’re talking about generating stuff, like text and even pictures. It’s all about using maths to predict what comes next. Rachel Arthur: That’s fascinating! But AI sometimes gets a bad reputation for making mistakes or even presenting fiction as fact. What’s your take on that? Jon Chippindall: Oh, for sure! AI isn’t perfect. It’s all about algorithms and maths. It might seem super smart, but it’s really just predicting based on what it’s learned. Sometimes it gets it wrong or even makes stuff up. We had issues in the past with it completely making up children to go on the class list, rather than using the list provided so we had to remove that feature! Rachel Arthur: Oh wow, it would be worrying to suddenly have an extra pupil in my class! So, in your experience how has AI been shaking things up in classrooms? Jon Chippindall: It’s been a game-changer! AI’s great at automating tasks, like creating lesson plans and worksheets. It saves teachers a ton of time, but it’s important to remember that teachers still play a crucial role in overseeing and tweaking these AI-generated resources. Rachel Arthur: Teacher workload is such a big issue, its great that these tools are genuinely saving teachers time. Where do you see AI in education going in the future? Jon Chippindall: The possibilities are endless! Imagine personalised learning resources tailored to each student’s needs, created in an instant. It’s all about freeing up teachers to focus on the human side of teaching, like connecting with students and providing that personalised touch. So, if you look at that kind of process of ‘plan, teach, review’, you know that cycle that good teaching is based upon, at the moment we’re focusing on the plan stage and we’re really impacting there. There’s obviously discussions happening around what it can do in the review piece, the marking piece, the general consensus at the moment is that the technology is not there yet. It’s not reliable enough yet. Rachel Arthur : Yeah, it sounds like there’s still some way to go. What’s driving the improvement then? Jon Chippindall: Well, it’s one thing having a mistake, you know, like wrong dates in a worksheet with teachers checking that. It’s another thing having pupils’ marks and lives impacted on through AI error. But this is just the start of this technology. You know, it’s only going to improve and when computers continue to become more powerful in terms of processing that’s the main thing that drives the improvement. Rachel Arthur: That makes sense. So, do you think AI will eventually handle more aspects of the teaching process? Jon Chippindall: Absolutely. There will come a point where you can do the rest of the cycle as well, and then the teachers are offloading everything that can be automated and probably done better and focus on the bits that can’t be done by machines. Rachel Arthur: That sounds promising! But what about fears of AI taking over jobs? Jon Chippindall: Oh, I get it, but AI isn’t here to replace teachers. It’s here to support them, to handle the tasks that can be automated, so teachers can focus on what they do best—inspiring and guiding their students. From my experience, much of the fear stems from a lack of understanding. Teachers often worry that AI will replace them, but in reality, it’s about augmenting their abilities, not replacing them. Banning AI outright doesn’t solve the issue either, as it’s challenging to detect its usage. Education is key here, helping people understand how to use AI responsibly. Rachel Arthur : Absolutely. It seems there’s still much to learn about AI’s role in education. So, for teachers interested in exploring AI, where should they start? Jon Chippindall: If you’re considering using AI tools in your teaching, it’s crucial to understand that when you’re using free online large language models, you’re not the customer, you’re the product. Your inputs are used to train the models, so caution is key, especially in educational settings. I’d recommend starting with TeachMateAI, which offers a range of free tools and is fully compliant with data protection regulations. Explore the platform, experiment with different inputs, and get a feel for what AI can do. Just have a play with it. Rachel Arthur: And what could a teacher who’s never used any AI tools before do today after registering for a free account? Jon Chippindall: Once you’ve registered for a free account, you can dive into the Activity Ideas Generator. Simply input the concept you’re teaching, and instantly receive 10 different activity ideas, including some that incorporate technology. You can also interact with the AI, asking for more ideas or further details on specific activities. It’s a great way to inject creativity into lesson planning and discover new approaches to engage students. Rachel Arthur: So if I’ve got lessons to plan for next week, and I’m always using the same resources and activities. But this could give me that creativity and spark back while planning. Jon Chippindall: Exactly. It’s like having another colleague beside you, offering fresh perspectives and ideas. Especially when you have themed weeks or special events, like World Recycling Day, but still need to cover core learning objectives, the AI can help generate relevant and engaging activities. It takes the pressure off and provides a wealth of ideas to explore. Rachel Arthur: And if I have managed to get some budget from my school what do the pro features look like? Jon Chippindall : One of the standout features in our recent update is the ability to link tools together. For example, you can start with a medium-term plan, inputting your curriculum objectives and time frame, and it will generate a comprehensive plan covering all necessary topics. From there, you can extract learning objectives for each week, and the AI will produce lesson plans, teaching slides, and worksheets tailored to your needs. It’s a time-saver, allowing you to plan an entire scheme of work in just 20 minutes, with the flexibility to refine and tweak as needed. Another exciting feature is the refinement bar, which enables iterative discussions with the AI. If the output slightly misses the mark, you can request expansions or additional assessment questions, fostering collaboration with the AI to fine-tune materials. Additionally, we’ve introduced tools like converting YouTube videos into educational content, including slides and comprehension questions, streamlining the process of incorporating resources into lessons. Rachel Arthur: That sounds brilliant, I know I struggled to come up with questions from videos at the end of a long day, so if there’s a tool that can suggest some for me then that’s great! Jon Chippindall: It’s all about efficiency and enhancing creativity. With our tools, you can generate quizzes directly from videos, which can be seamlessly integrated with platforms like Kahoot, saving you time and effort. We’ve also prioritised community collaboration, recently engaging with teachers interested in SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities). Their feedback has been invaluable in shaping new tools tailored to meet diverse learning needs. Rachel Arthur : And how are teachers finding the tool? Are they seeing its making a difference? Jon Chippindall: Absolutely! We regularly hear heartwarming stories from individual teachers who have found TeachMateAI to be a game-changer in reclaiming their personal time. Teachers often share on our ‘TeachMateAI Teachers’ Facebook group how the platform has allowed them to enjoy time with their families, like playing in the park or walking their dog. It feels amazing to know that our tools have made a real difference for teachers, helping them balance their workload and rediscover their love for teaching. Lots of them have told us that having more time has stopped them from thinking about quitting their jobs, showing how much of a positive impact it can have to have more time in the classroom. Rachel Arthur: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like TeachMateAI is not just about streamlining teaching tasks but also about fostering a healthier work-life balance for educators. With that, Jon, I’d like to thank you for sharing your insights and expertise on AI in education. It’s been a pleasure chatting with you today!

Quickly, Easily, On the go. We make studying as quick as 2 seconds to open your app to a scheduled flashcard. Because we understand that getting out of bed to study is half the battle. Scheduled Flashcard? Like Anki etc? Yes, we do that too to maximise your learning curve + motivation. Learning Curve... and Motivation? Why care? We believe motivation is the greatest determinant of success due to psychology research. Why can't I plan my studying? Why can't the AI There is value in planning and feel free to use your own planning apps. For flashcards, we've found Plans don't survive a punch in the face. Until you know what you need to learn next, you can't predict how long it will take. For example if you repeat most cards twice rather than thrice, that means in all future studying you'll probably need more time for those cards too. Our AI uses that prediction to optimise your studying. But to be accurate, it cannot see too far (a trade off). We won't promise you things we don't think work right now, and autoplanning up to your exam/essay due date is one of those. We are happy to be proven wrong. You can manually plan and use estimates. Award Winning Revision AI Quiz Generator View Demo Quiz The Ultimate Learning Experience Our goal is to deliver the ultimate learning experience, in a practical, evidence-informed way based on a clear goal: Making your studying more effective and enjoyable. We've been on this mission since being students in 2019!

When we make flashcards, we carefully select them to perfectly fit your lecture . The flashcards focus on different stages of learning (familiarising, recall, expression and synthesizing) with spaced repetition to get you higher grades. Why study with AI flashcards? Roediger, H.L. & Karpicke, J.D. (2006) found test scores increased from 41%(SSSS) to 60%(STTT) when quizzing vs re-reading: +19% Grade Average Our AI flashcards for science subjects and the organised, high-coverage learning mode we generate for you are more effective than highlighting and watching lectures (Bartlett, 1977,  Johnson & Mayer, 2009). For example, Roediger et al. (2011) identified Ten benefits of active retrieval(using flashcards), which we applied, as design guidance. We are GDPR-compliant, collecting minimal PII, except your learning records. Exercises make studying feel better Our tool doesn't just make AI flashcards, it also groups them into bitesize Exercises. Conquer and feel progress as you complete them! As you study, you unlock more exercises - motivating you for your exams! ...and this progress will motivate you At any time you can visually see progress you make on each exercises flashcards When it comes to using AI for Revision, this is the best way to ensure you cover content and keep on track! We put careful thought into our design to bring in elements that maximise your learning when we present & make flashcards for you. Frequently Asked Questions Is it free? Yes, you can try generating AI flashcards for free, and add manual flashcards to sets. What's special about Exercises? Yes, you can try generating AI flashcards for free, and add manual flashcards to sets. How can I plan with Revision.ai? Yes, you can try generating AI flashcards for free, and add manual flashcards to sets. Will I be able to track progress? Yes, you can try generating AI flashcards for free, and add manual flashcards to sets. Can Revision.ai adapt to my mistakes and help me overcome misconceptions? Absolutely. Revision.ai uses forward-thinking technology, which detect your mistakes. Going above and beyond standard spaced repetition algorithms, we also collect qualitative feedback. Example If you answer several questions on Cars correctly, but are bad at questions on Motorbikes, Revision.ai will reflect and choose questions to identify your misconceptions, like focusing a question on Wheels. Once it identifies a possible misconception, it will create questions to overcome the mistake and represent this in the percentage completeness of your lecture! You can see the systems ""Third Brain"" score-card and list of your strengths, mistakes and misconceptions in addition to normal progress. This way, you can jump right into quizzes on your mistake topics, show them or discuss them with others, and reflect yourself on your learning. You can also add manual text input on your own thoughts on your areas of mistakes/reflections, to direct the AI your way too. One of the brilliant ways Revision.ai helps you be a better student than otherwise is that it can see patterns in things you might not understand. For example, imagine during a long lecture the following pictures are present, as in Open Stax Biology lectures: These are regions of the brain, and the region at the back of the brain is important for vision. If you struggle with answering questions about regions of the brain, but succeed at labeling the visual system, the ""Third Brain"" will create new text questions asking you to choose the right description for regions in the brain and it will provide you a short synopsis of the regions first to recap them. So this way, even though the original lecture assumed you knew about Brain Regions - in your case an untrue assumption which held back deeper learning - now, with Revision.ai, you can accomplish that foundational step to build the groundwork for learning about specific regions, or reasoning about how regions interact! This is the power of the both reflective, learning record and text based analysis that the Third Brain does, when constantly providing a fresh supply of New, Relevant, Answerable questions as you study. Can the Third Brain system build me up to getting great grades on my exam? According to our 50,000+ users, the system is ideal for Biology, Business, Neuroscience and Psychology students and helping with passing exams. By generating a comprehensive set of questions that cover each part of your slides and keeping a record of your knowledge, the system can constantly provide you fresh, relevant, exam-conditions-like questions as you go up into completing the whole lecture and completing it increasingly accurately as you study. Until you have consistently covered 80% of the lecture with 80% accuracy, the system always adapts and highlights to show you the next exercise you should study - by doing this, you do not have to think about it or struggle with analysis paralysis - you can just jump into conquering a small part of your lecture one after another to succeed! The Trophy system (provided only to skilled successful recalls of information from your slides) provides an accurate judgement of passing exams at US college level in our experience. Remember, the contributors to Revision.ai include 6 college graduates, with above average grades, so we know what you need to do to score well on exams! It is our belief that if you have recently achieved trophies on each exercise in your lecture, within the last 2 weeks before the exam, you will go in as one of the strongest students and get the grade you need. What you need is the discipline and hard work on studying on the run up to that, in the regular months before hand - and we help take a big part of the early and intimidating work by generating all your flashcards/practise questions for you. It feels lighter, and more calm, to study with Revision.ai this way. What Psychology research informed your approach? Our founder has a MSc Psychology degree with a focus on learning, as do two of our current/former interns. We use our knowledge of the subject area to apply several research findings, as detailed in our articles and technically in terms of their implementation here. Highlights of the research we have applied includes: The Testing Effect Spaced Repetition Summative Feedback research Misconception Refutation - Progress Gamification Mastery and indvidiualised feedback/planning - Blooms research Chi & Posners Theories of error types and learning modes What are the stages of learning on Revision.ai Revision.ai starts you off with the flashcards it has made for you for a given lecture. From there, you study exercises, one by one, gaining progress. The separation into exercises splits your lecture into relevant slides for that topic, and gives you a surmountable amount of questions for each exercise that fits your attention span. By taking them in order, you can familiarize yourself with the lecture, no matter how confusing some parts might be. As you answer questions to make progress in each exercise, you can ask the AI to explain with context to your lecture: Each time you study, the AI adapts the cards based on spaced repetition, and other factors. Each time you complete a session, you can view your strengths/weaknesses that session with a knowledge gap report: Once you are confident, you can use the Mastery mode, where you view slides, and then need to write out what you remember for a blurt/free recall rating from the system. This ""Learning Loop"" takes you from a few slides, to a few questions, then to recalling what you know. It's purpose-built to optimize your memory with a mix of easy and hard cognitive work for your brain - and to deliberately connect back to your original lecture with the slides relevant for the topic , while also ensuring that you are recalling information in exam-like conditions , the combination of which ensures you learn the right content (the lecture) in a comprehensive way, in the most effective method/fashion for the exam you need to take. Just stop and think for a second. How good does it feel to know you just accurately recalled most of the content of a topic in your lecture, and correctly answered short questions on it? Wouldn't that give you massive confidence for the exam and put you in flow state? This is the exact reason, as well as difficulty learning diagrams, that we built Revision.ai for Biology! Then, you gather Trophies for each exercise by accurately free recalling what the lectures say and answering short questions, like in exams! As you go, the system builds up a teacher-like picture of you, understanding the misconceptions and mistakes you are making, and any patterns you show. By looking at these, you can take rectifying learning , which quickly provides information on the misconception/issue, and then tests you on it. Your progress is also represented for the whole lecture in the overview, so you can complete each lecture. What's the evidence that this approach is more effective or advanced than simple spaced repetition? Yes, you can try generating AI flashcards for free, and add manual flashcards to sets. How does keeping track of my misconceptions help me get better grades? It's what you don't know and what your marker can tell you don't actually know that hurts you during marking.
                  Read our post on getting into the mind of the marker. Misconceptions being resolved is arguably the most effective way to improve academics core in a subject according to Mueller (2008) and following studies. It requires you to really intrinsically change your thinking patterns, reflect and overcome a hurdle mentally. What is the purpose of Mastery mode showing my slides for different topics in the lecture? It's key to the learning loop to let you soak in the information in context.
                  It A) activates the contextual memory from when you first learned it, from what the lecture was saying and what you were thinking,
                  but also B) enables you to focus right before you go into questions and blurting the material. Our design around the Mastery mode learning loop going ""Slides"", ""Questions"", ""Blurt"" is purposeful.
                  It enables you to tackle a topic comprehensively not just in terms of looking at all the relevant content, but testing your knowledge at different levels of difficulty to establish what you know, and in doing so, improving your knowledge of the topic. See here is the thing. I actually quite like listening to lectures, especially the first time. They are interesting! The highlights are great, and memorable-by-default to me. But the bits inbetween. The foundations. The information on the methods used, related/foundational studies - or the diagrams - learning those parts helps your career, your future, your academic understanding and going on to do research. But it does not stick out, and will not stick in your brain, unless you study those parts purposefully. Now you can try the traditional approach to make flashcards covering all parts and that's fine, but it is nowhere near as sophtiscated or effective as using the right learning techniques. It's also harder to not feel a daunting sense of fear that way - you can see the number you have studied correctly sure, but it's hard to study 300 cards. Every wrong one feels a bit worrying. The difference with our seperation of the topics into exercises and then taking Mastery mode for each of them is that you can consolidate your motivation, focus your attention, and show yourself as you apply effecitve learning methods that you can learn this topic, and can succeed. That's the feeling we want you to have and the rationale behind why the learning loop - informed by research - is built how it is. How does the AI motivate me? Yes, you can try generating AI flashcards for free, and add manual flashcards to sets. References Roediger, H. L., & Karpicke, J. D. (2006).
