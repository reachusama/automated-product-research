This technology uses algorithms that work to analyze the essay factors, including grammar, spelling, word choice, syntax, and others, to generate a grade or score for the essay content. Since automated grading solutions have gained interest and their adoption has grown recently, education and assessments have moved increasingly to more online and digital formats. Advocates point to many potential pros, such as saving teachers’ time, getting rid of scoring bias, and offering an immediate response back to students. Critics argue that accuracy limitations, scoring integrity, and effects on students are cons, but they do not exist. This article examines the key pros and cons of using essay AI grader today and projections for the future. We’ll analyze the capabilities and limitations of current solutions, present use cases and statistics on real-world implementation, review impacts on educators and students, and discuss the outlook for advancement as AI and NLP evolve. The Rise of Automated Grading Solutions Automated grading technology originated in the 1960s, but its capabilities remained extremely limited until recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In the past decade, major strides have occurred in NLP and neural networks that can analyze written text and language more accurately than ever before. Several vendors now provide AI-based essay scoring solutions used by hundreds of universities, public school districts, and testing organizations worldwide. The largest provider, EdX, supports essay grading for tests like the SAT, GMAT, and TOEFL. Public schools in at least 21 U.S. states use automated scoring to handle growing numbers of written exams and asynchronous assignments. Use continues to rise rapidly. Recent estimates project that the global automated essay scoring software market size was valued at approximately USD 0.25 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 0.75 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 12% from 2023 to 2032 . This represents a major shift in automated grading adoption to keep pace with remote and digital learning trends. Pros of Automated Essay Grading Automated essay scoring delivers several potential benefits that explain its surging usage. Saves Teachers’ Time Grading written essays and assignments represents one of teachers’ most labor-intensive, time-consuming tasks. Automated solutions can significantly expedite the process and alleviate this burden. For example, estimates show teachers may spend upwards of 10-15 minutes grading a single essay. For a class of 25 students, that equates to 4-6 hours spent. Automated scoring can evaluate essays in 1 minute or less per essay, saving teachers hours of manual work and freeing up more time for lesson planning, teaching, and providing student feedback. Provides Rapid Student Feedback Related to saving teachers’ time, automated grading also enables students to receive scores and feedback on written assignments much faster. Rather than waiting days or weeks for teachers to grade papers, automated systems can evaluate submissions within seconds and instantly provide students with their essay scores. Immediate performance feedback allows students to pinpoint writing areas to improve sooner. And research shows faster feedback also leads to better long-term retention and skills development. Eliminates Subjective Scoring Biases Unlike human graders who inherently apply subjective biases and preferences to essay scoring, automated grading solutions utilize unbiased, objective AI algorithms. Most systems are trained on millions of essay examples to develop scoring rules that grade elements like semantics, vocabulary, and topical content accuracy without favoritism. Through machine learning advancements, leading essay scoring engines have successfully minimized algorithmic biases as well. This results in impartial scores based strictly on essay quality versus grader biases that can negatively or positively influence human-graded scores. Facilitates Large-Scale Assessments Automated grading provides a scalable solution to accommodate high-volume essay and short-answer scoring needs for large testing organizations. For instance, one vendor’s AI grading tool reports an ability to score 400 billion short-answer questions a year – a volume practically impossible for human graders. Such capacity enables more frequent, large-scale assessments to better gauge student learning and refine instruction programs systemwide. A few states now administer formative assessments every 2-3 weeks and credit AI scoring for making this feasible, where manpower cannot. Cons of Automated Essay Grading While automated essay scoring delivers noteworthy upside, legitimate downsides and limitations exist. Cannot Match Human Grading Accuracy The most significant disadvantage is that algorithmic grading cannot yet match human accuracy and perceptiveness. Although AI capabilities advance annually, fully mimicking human language comprehension and cognition remains complex and challenging. Most automated engines still struggle to analyze semantics, inference, creativity, and other higher-order skills that human graders intuitively recognize in writing. Sophisticated arguments, original ideas, humor, irony, and other subjective language qualities pose accuracy issues as well. Risks of Formulaic and Structured Writing Critics argue that automated essay scoring, because algorithms analyze writing style and structures versus ideas, incentivizes formulaic, uninspired writing geared to please AI models versus demonstrate true skills. For instance, long essays using complex vocabulary may receive strong scores regardless of substance. Additionally, well-trained models can usually recognize content with high plagiarism quite well. However, students may discover “tricks” to slightly manipulate copied text to avoid plagiarism detection. This could promote cheating if applied incorrectly to high-stakes assessments. In both cases, the concern is that automated scoring’s limitations may distort writing instruction if teachers and students fixate solely on superficial styles and structures rewarded by AI. Without balancing human scoring, writing quality may shift toward template-based versus original, creative structures, which would set back skill development. Lacks Qualitative Feedback Most automated scoring systems can assign grades and provide basic quantitative feedback explaining score calculations. However, algorithms struggle to deliver meaningful qualitative analysis with constructive suggestions to improve, like human graders. Rating scale criteria are also limited, often reducing essay quality to a 1-6 numeric score. Such simplified metrics fail to capture the nuances and growth opportunities that teachers’ individualized comments can provide. Students lose out on important coaching tailored to their needs that generic AI feedback lacks presently. Perception of Impartiality Finally, despite aiming for unbiased objectivity, studies show students often view automated scoring as less fair and trustworthy than teacher grading. Students believe human readers better understand concepts and contexts to judge work impartially versus bots. Negative perception erodes student confidence in scoring integrity. Further, some observers believe overdependence on algorithms to evaluate writing risks dehumanizing instruction as an impersonal, numerical process versus nurturing talent. Outlook for Advancements in Automated Grading The above cons reveal real downsides to curbing the more ubiquitous implementation of automated essay evaluation technologies today. However, rapid evolution continues, suggesting AI capabilities will advance markedly in the coming years to address many current limitations. Several developments show strong promise. First, scoring accuracy continues to progress as machine learning models receive more training data. For example, leading vendors now claim scoring parity with human graders, predicting models will exceed average teacher accuracy by 2025. Natural language generation advancements also show potential for automated feedback. New models like GPT-4 demonstrate improving capabilities, summarizing key points, and generating specific qualitative feedback superior to current template comments. Additionally, to counter risks of formulaic writing, adaptive scoring algorithms show promise in assessing higher-order analysis like critical thinking versus writing style alone. Models in development also aim to detect sophisticated cheating attempts better. Finally, enhanced system validation and external audits on scoring fairness may further build user confidence and acceptance if applied properly to ease perception issues. Conclusion Advancing artificial intelligence has the potential to lead to an automated essay scoring application of great transformational value in education. Real benefits such as teacher time savings, fast, unbiased scores to improve writing assessments are already being delivered by leading systems. However, as with any legitimate cons, the accuracy limitations and the impact on writing quality show that there is still some evolution to come. It is conceivable in the near term that automated grading solutions will become viable alternatives to low-stakes assessment, and in the long term, partners could continue to play a role in grading high-stakes tests alongside their counterparts.

Let’s tackle the last one first.  I didn’t say that I’m unsympathetic to the idea that more writing would happen if there was less grading to do.  Certainly, one reason that writing isn’t happening enough in classrooms now is that there’s a perception that every piece written must be “marked” or “graded” or “bled upon” by a teacher.  That’s completely false and a terrible idea. What our students need isn’t so many end comments or suggestions for grammatical or technical correction, but they need to be responded to as writers by readers who are reading their work.   says this far smarter than I ever could, but we teachers should be doing less evaluating and more responding. So, yes.  Teachers are taking too long with papers.  The answer isn’t to stop reading them. It’s to read them differently.  Or to have more teachers reading fewer students’ writing.  And we don’t need to read everything that a student writes.  We certainly don’t need to grade everything a student writes. Where I think this gets messy is, as , is the notion that students need more grading from us in order to get better as writers.  They do not.  They need for we teachers to write with them, and to create cultures of inquiry and reflection rather than regurgitation in our classrooms.  They need to be treated as apprentice writers and brought up accordingly. Robotic graders are for people too busy to read the work our students are investing in.  That’s not fair to our students. Now, to clarify.  I’ve ben in classrooms where existing writing assessment software has been used, and I’ve been pleasantly surprised by what I’ve seen.  My most recent experience with a writing assessment tool was in a middle school classroom in my school district, where a gifted teacher was using the tool as a starting place for her writing courses.  The software did free her up to be in conversation with her students about their writing.  That was just the right way for her and the class to be – the students drafting, the teacher conversing and reading and being with her students. The students wrote more and revised more.  In talking with them, they felt a connection to their teacher and that she was concerned for them as writers.  The software was a scaffold, and a place to start. I was okay with that.  More than okay.  The teacher made the classroom shine.  The software augmented the teacher.  She could’ve run a similar, maybe not as prolific, writing workshop with her students using only paper and pencil. And she read what they wrote.  And encouraged them to share their writing with each other. Writing for a machine to read all the time, though, is not really writing.  It’s pretending.  It’s make believe.  And not the good and playful kind.  It’s faking it when there’s not an other someone reading at least some of the work.  We want our students to write well not because they’ll need to do so in some far off future job.  We want them to write well because they have something important to say to the world right now. So let me clarify further.  I get how the computers do the “reading” that they do 1 .  And I won’t completely knock it.  It’s handy if you need to score a bunch of tests in a hurry. And that’s one kind of writing – writing as proof of knowing.  But it’s writing that assumes unimportance. And it’s writing that suggests that the students could build their own robot essay writers to write their essays for them.  In fact, that’s what an awful lot of student “cheating” cases are – they’re crowdsourcing their homework.  Some students do that out of malicious intent.  Others out of ignorance.  But too many students fake their way through essays out of boredom, and out of the knowledge that the teacher’ll be in a hurry and probably not notice. You’ve got to notice what your students are doing.  And you’re going to miss some things.  But you can’t miss all of them.  Maybe even most. I don’t think a machine grading writing is the end-all of everything I hold dear.  I’m sympathetic to the argument that our students need to write more and perhaps the machines will encourage that.  But the fervor with which I suspect machine grading of writing will be adopted suggests the real problem – we don’t actually want to read and write with our students.  We want to do reading and writing to them.  And that’s wrong. By the way,  is worth your time if you want to understand the processes and processing involved.

I right now am on a journey to learn how to help my students be better readers and writers. I can say that the “training” I received in college 18 years ago didn’t help much. I can honestly say that five years ago I would have loved a program that graded student writing and I can also say that it would have done it more competently than myself. Reply The problem is that automated essay grading is already seriously distorting the curriculum.  Look at the Common Core standards.  When Common Core did some international benchmarking in an early draft, it was crystal clear that compared to other standards, they’d systematically removed parts of the reading and writing standards that could not be scored by computer. If we go down this path, before too long the algorithm will become the standard.  The computer will be seen as more reliable and valid than human graders — there will be no possible argument against the software, because the software will be the standard. Also, I agree that this software can be beneficial in a limited role. Reply When people view the role of writing assessment as something that results in a grade, they are missing the point. Feedback and review should highlight opportunities for improvement. It should be a process of asking questions, as opposed to making statements. Feedback and review need to be grounded in at least a passing knowledge of grammatical sentence types, rhetorical sentence types, verb choice, sentence length, pacing, zeugma, the judicious use of polysyndeton, and other devices that help creative minds illustrate ideas more effectively. The largest disservice that robo graders do is highlight the myth that a piece of writing is ever done beyond the point of improvement. There are times when it’s necessary to just finish something and be done with it, but that is a different skill set than expressing oneself creatively with words. Robo graders narrow the conversation, and help people confound assessment with knowledge, and a grade with learning. Assessment and grades are indicators of a point in time; learning to write (and learning to edit) is a process of asking questions. Reply Attending a writing project summer institute changed my way of teaching!  It forced me to look at teaching as a process where I worked side by side with my students in writing, reading and even math to build knowledge.  We collaborated, shared ideas, shared writing, drafted and did all of the things that occur in a “workshop” format.  By the time a piece of writing was turned in for a grade, the process had morphed the piece into a finished product.  One student had his/her name on it, but it was a work produced from a class of writers who advised each other through the process so there were no surprises what the grade would be. It takes effort and time to build a classroom culture like that.  It really helps when the teacher sits down in front of the class and asks for their advice/input on his/her writing, then the students truly believe they are valued members of a writing community.
